Graphics and sound are spot on to deliver the whole oldschool feel the game is going for. The game has an R-Type / Gradius kind of vibe to it, and also delivers on quantity and quality of content.\nThere are lots of different stages that all have a different theme to them. And that doesnt just mean different graphics, also different hazards and enemies. One time you have to navigate through an asteroid field, next time you take on a huge fleet of battleships, and then you fly through some plants that grow around you. So the game will give you a very diverse experience.\nEach time you beat a level, you also get a new primary-, secondary-, or bomb kind of weapon, and you can freely choose between those whenever you choose your next level. Yeah you can choose your next level too. There are different paths you can take to play through the game. Its not a very complex structure, but it is enough to give you some options to try out when you dont feel like you want to try a stage for the 5th time in a row. And until you became somewhat good at this game you will try and try again.\nIf oldschool shoot'em ups are your kind of thing, you need to play Super Hydorah.

When I heard Super Hydorah was being made, I of course jumped on it as soon as it was released.\u00a0\nThe traditional horizontal shooter style reminds me the most of Gradius. Spefically the Gradius IV/Gradius Gaiden era of the series. This also extends to the music, which has that funky jazz fusion/rock vibe. The controls, gameplay mechanics, and power up system is simple enough where you can dive into it immediately. It provides a good challenge but isn't overwhelmingly daunting. It has multiple paths and several hidden secrets to keep you invested in it. I especially like the fact that you can save/load your progress and pickup on where you left off at any time as you traverse through the multiple paths to the end.\u00a0\nOverall, I'm going to echo what was mostly said about this game already and say that it is very well crafted. The dev was obviously mindful of the elements that make a good traditional shooter and was sure to craft that into this game. The Gryzor87 composed soundtrack is great too. \"No Mercy\" in particular I enjoy.

I won't bore you by talking about how great the artwork & music are, just look at the trailer & demo for those. What I would like to mention is how incredibly dialed in the game play is. These guys have mastered the art of making 5-10 projectiles a serious threat, they don't need 5,000 bullets to do that. The game design carefully rewards spatial awareness, reaction time & tactics, over rote memorization and extreme precision. It's difficult, you're gonna die a lot, but the deaths come with minimal frustration. Almost every time I've died, it's provoked a shrug and a \"Alright that was a fair call\" sentiment. I would say this game is both more difficult, and more fair than any of the great classics, gradius 1/2/3, salamander/life force, etc. 2 player mode is great, if you've got someone that will sit on the couch with you for some good old fashioned gradius fun, definitely give it a try.\nThe ship uprade system is overall very good. The weapon choices you have before each level are meaningful decisions. Death only knocks a little bit of power off your primary & secondary weapons, which is a lot nicer than sending you back to the stone age every time you fly into a wall. It's difficult at first to build up many speed & special attack upgrades, but the game is managable even when your ship has lost most of it's power. I've had to resort to killing most bosses on my first play through with a peashooter and no speed upgrades left.\nI've got a couple minor nitpicks, but they're mostly subjective stuff and shouldn't discourage anyone from trying the game out:\n1) I wish there was a little more red & blue color on the ships in 2P mode. When you're flying level, there's only about 5 pixels of identifying color which can make it difficult to tell them apart, especially if your housemate is RUDE and insists on equipping the same weapons as you for each level.\n2) It's a little difficult to experiment with special weapons when you're a beginner. I see the need to decrement your special weapon charge count by one on death, that's a good call. But maybe you could be kind enough to only decrement us down to 1 in stead of all the way to 0. ;)", "hours": 36.7, "user_id": "76561198005746468", "username": "NoRoo", "products": 43, "early_access": false}

While the game borrows many elements from classic titles, it feels fresh and unique. Unlike most other shooters of this kind, Super Hydorah supports analog controls. At first I wasn't a fan of this, but after a while I got used to it and even with maxed out speed upgrades you can still maneuver precisely. There are also secrets to find in each stage.\nShoot 'em up veterans will have no problems blazing through the game and even a 1CC run is achievable for most players. That's not to say that the game is easy. The levels are challenging, but fair. Checkpoints within levels and a save system after each stage help newcomers. There are unlimited continues, but if you run out of lives you get send back to the start of the level. Some stages are pretty long and new players might have some trouble beating them.

I HATE this more than anything and will seldom give a game the light of day that uses this very bad and clich\u00e9 technique!  You cannot jump without the game glitching, which annoys the hell out of me!\nAs simple as the graphics are, it either seems they make the load times extremely slow to make the game feel old, or it is very unoptimzed!  Far cry and every other advanced game loads faster!\nThe graphic design was endearing for about 60 secs, then all the issues overwhelmed me :(\nThe hitboxes are very poorly configured, where you can touch baddies, only just not their core.  It is hard to know when you will be hit or not.\nMovement is slow, attack is laggy and jump delayed :(\nControls are very BAD, very restrictive!  You can attack or jump but not at the same time, so if there is a fast action where you need to attack, then quickly jump to avoid a projectile, forget about it!  The attack action takes so long to complete, until you are able to jump again.\nFor example, during second boss fight (library), you want to quickly attack, but you have to end up counting your shots, then prematurely stop shooting, since you will not be able to avoid his attack unless you are standing stationary and ready!  Not nimble at all!\nAlso, trying to jump down from platforms, you press down and jump, but it only works half the time (jumping up once, before allowing you to jump down).\nPoorly designed baddie actions that can be unavoidable (really detracts from joy)...I enjoy tough as nails, but don't like illogically challenging.

Like many of the other reviews mentioned, the graphics and the music were both amazing. But also like many of the other reviews mentioned, the game is currently a little short of content.\nSome pros:\n- The theme is awesome. The game play is really smooth and I like how the resources are balanced. You don't see common people hang around everywhere, which makes the game appear clean. The only click-able units are fighting units, which you would occasionally want to click on in order to check on their status.\n- I like how population translates directly into money instead of being mediated by resources. When there are too many resources to manage I tend to get confused and anxious. In this game, fundamentally, you just have to balance building huts (population) and assigning farmwork. Other resources are important, but won't break your kingdom (as long as you have a market). I didn't need to worry about, e.g., my citizens not having jobs but still consume food (a big problem I had back with age of empires).\n- Graphics! Music! Again, huge promises.\nSome cons:\n- As much as there are a lot of elements existing in the game, the strategy ended up being quite linear. The best attack strategy seems to be tornados, which also ends up being cheaper (if you buy mana at market) than investing in fighting units. I spent a lot of time and resources having my wizards, knights, and marksmen learning all kinds of skills, having them ride on rivens and eagles, spamming them with healing health, only to have them die to enemy ground units super quickly. I won my first game by using 3 tornados to destroy enemy castle. It would've taken me at least another 3 hours if I had to do it with only fighting units. I like the idea of directly participating in fights like using tornados, but the uselessness of my units was kind of a bummer.\n- Relatedly, unit commands are a little too simple and the AI doesn't seem very good. I couldn't find a way of sending one unit home (the one everyone's attacking and is about to die) while letting others continue. I also never really observed my wizards use their tornados.\nBottom line:\nAgain, super impressed by this early access already.

Coins can be used to create a checkpoint or exanged for health\nIt's a game that can provide some challenges in small sections of each map. But the entire room itself is relatively easy to clear.\nAnd thats because the only restriction as to how many times you can create a checkpoint, is the amount of coins you hold. In this case you need very few, and since coins remain even after each level. it will always be enough to save the game, just before facing multiple foes.\nThis took me long to get used to.\nThe problem was everything about it feels slow and restrictive. The roll itself, is incredibly short.\nIt didn't seem useful, until a noticed:\nA - The  invincibility frames are the entire roll animation.\nB - You may run really slowly, but roll jumping can clear large distances.\nIt's a game changer, my main issue with the game from that point on was the shooting mechanics.\nNot only shooting arrows restricts your movement, sometimes it's really hard to reach that perfect high to hit an enemy.\nAnd both possible options bring the game to an halt. Close or far, you're either holding the shoot button or constantly pressing the roll to avoid getting hit youself.\nIt's a solid game. It controls fine, with the exception of the shooting mechanics.\nAnd in terms of graphics and level design, it is what you paid for. Compared to more expensive platformers it is repetitive.

It's unfortunate that these 30 minutes of gameplay were enough to leave me with an opinion.\nCore Mechanics:\n(+) As someone that played it before release, I'll put it out that the game plays better than it used to. The controls are more responsive and it happens less often that I get a false sense of the height of my jump or distance of my landing.\n(-) There is, however, a slight amount of letdown in terms of what can and cannot be done. You can't shoot upwards, you can't shoot downwards. This gimmick would've made some of the challanges easier, surely, since the game has a bit of a fetish for things falling on your head.\n(~) Deaths are annoying. The price for Checkpoints and Life Statues seems arbitrary. There is a great deal of unfairness here which for the platformer-arcade lover may seem inexistentent; not though for those of us without such godly coordonation and keeness for replaying the same level.\nDanger Variety:\n(~) Deaths which feel cheap aplenty. I took some time to watch some videos of youtubers and they all seems to endorse words such as 'rage' and 'hard'. If that's your deal, more power to you.\n(+) There's a decent variety in the death you'll be dealt. For lack of better terms, there's falling goombas, there's running goombas, there's jumping goombas, there's bats that encircle you. Just alike the platformers you're used with, it's not in the individual obstacle the place where the challange lies, but within the crammed corners, spiked edges and (un)fruitful combinations of enemies.\nPromise of Something Bigger:\n(+) There is a sense of something going on here. There are skeletons with messages here and there, as they do. There are spikes and enemies the existence of which seems to be centered solely upon your demise - again, as they do. The game doesn't hide from the fact that it's nothing more than it appears to be - you're a boy, in a very dungeony dungeon, you run from one corner to the other. Maybe there's some aspects I don't know since I haven't reached that far, so take this with a pinch of salt.\n(+) On that side, now, the graphics are nice! They are not innovative by any means, but it's that good old juicy pixelart we all love.\n(-) It's not an atmosphere to enjoy by standing still, however. Somehow, one not to enjoy whilst running either at times - there's the same track, haunting you, reminding you that you're doing the same thing over and over again. At some point it seems like it's laughing at my attempts with its cheeky notes.\n(-) The levels aren't compelling. It's not that they are bad - they are decent. Yet, is decent enough? That depends from person to person, surely, but I fear that I can't let this slide. Decent is good, but decent is not great. There are new mechanics added to the levels in a well paced manner - yet, they are mechanics we've seen a dozen/thousand times before.\nTiny Details:\n(~) It's a fine matter - let me reword it, a sensitive matter. There are details which evoke developer-love, such as the arrows that stuck, the tiny thing following you, so on so forth; But there could've been sooo much more love given. I would've liked the arrows to go slower through the water, or be affected in some way, the grass to be wiggly, the walk animation not to be unsynced with the distance travalled.\nOverall:\nWe can't make a good approximation of whether or not the title is worth without make a comparison to what we regard as 'worth'. Is it worth in terms of the time-spent cost? As not a big fan of the genre, I'll side with a 'noooot really' here. More like, with a 'worth-ish'. Is it worth in terms of the price-tag?

Who would take the time in creating such a games and self imposing the visual technical limitations of those specific years? not to mention doing that for free.\nSuper Hydorah is a really good game, but also you will appreciate its full potential if you have a well understanding of the Video games as an art form.\nAnd you can apply all I said here to the music, Gryzor87 has done an amazing job, if you don't believe me just wait till you arrive to the level called Verminest on Super Hydorah.", "hours": 74.9, "user_id": "76561198263037962", "username": "chindasvinto", "products": 6, "early_access": false}

It clearly takes heavy inspiration from games like Gradius, but while feeling modern and polished.\nIf you have experience with Gradius and liked it, you'll definitely like this. (I personally find it much better and far less frustrating than Gradius.)\nIf you don't have experience with games like Gradius but ya like shmups, this can still very well be quite appealing for you.\nSo, onto some basic things the game has:\nYour GUNS. You have various weapons at your disposal, specifcally: A Main weapon, a secondary weapon (like mines that shoot below you) and a bomb or active weapon that you get charges to use via a certain powerup. Most levels gives a new weapon unlock upon completion to add to what you can choose from. This can lead to some unique loadouts and even some neat synergies.\nPOWERUPS. There aren't many, which is fine for a game like this. There are little green orbs and red orbs you'll come across often. When you max out on either your fire power/fire rate will improve. Then there are the main big \"3\" power ups that you kill special enemies to get. This powerup, when dropped, alternates between a shield, an active weapon use, and speed/mobility upgrade.\nUsually, you want to get a shield if you lack one as it protects you from a hit before dying, and then go for the other two. You can have a total of three active weapon charges and the same goes with the speed upgrades. And when you die you lose some of all your power ups.\nLEVELS. The levels (from what I've done so far) are very well made and even hold some secrets. They all feel fair and I never felt a death wasn't my fault. Every boss is significantly different from the others and the pacing of the game is very nice as is the difficulty curve.\nThere are a lot of levels as well. This is an obvious gud thing. And as it says in the features list, the order of what levels you go through are non-linear! There are some branching paths in the level select screen so you can go through one set of levels or the other. There are also some \"special\" levels which are designed to be extra difficult but also reward a neat item.\nAN OBLIGATORY CONCLUSION.\nThey set out to make a modern Gradius and succeeded in every aspect. It's difficult but fair, and is one of the best shmups ever made I'd say. Heck, I'd say it's easily THE best I've ever played if we're talking horizontal shmups.\nAnd it's worth mentioning that the art style is perfect for capturing the retro look in a crisp, clean way. The soundtrack is also well done and fits perfectly with the game.\nSo yeah, it's good. I reccomend it. I enjoy it. Thumbs up.

Are there going to be more updates? New content? DLCs? Well, let's talk about it!\nOf course there are still going to be a bunch of updates with new features, fixes, and all that is needed to ensure a great gaming experience. But there is much more that's coming up! Here's an overview... Ready? Let's rock!\n--\nThe initial release of the\nfor Fernbus Coach Simulator is only a few days away!

Starting at initial release, we will publish videos that explain all the basics, and new episodes will follow that will explain the more detailed stuff. We just can't wait to see your first Mods!\n--\nAs our Modding Tools are just before release, we already want to announce that we're working on official\n: Austria and Switzerland (together), and France will be released as DLCs for Fernbus Coach Simulator, enabling you to ride your bus internationally!

But that's not all: This Feature Package will include many new contents for the game, including\n,\nthat will bring a great new graphical experience into the game, and\nthat might eventually cause you to wait a minute or two. We will soon announce the official release date of this DLC!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nWho said that there wouldn't be more coming up after the Neoplan Skyliner? Well, we have a little more coming up. There will be\n: One VDL package with 6 bus variants and another package with 5 bus variants of the ComfortClass. More details to follow...\n--\nNow this is really one of the wishes we've heard the most! The Fernbus Coach Simulator Entertainment Package will include a\nwithout commercials, over 70 licensed music titles, a MC with\n, an\nwith\nand\n!\n--\nWho said that your only job would be to drive passengers through Germany?

Bring the players to their games, make sure to drive responsibly, keep your bus clean and drive through the washer, keep the drinks fridge filled up and make sure to have a fair Wi-Fi on board. Make sure to head to the repair shop before it's too late, and compare prices of petrol stations, hotels, and more to find the best offer. Spending too much money won't make your boss happy, but being too stingy won't make your players happy. This is a new chapter - And you decide where it goes! We will soon detail the current development of this DLC here in our forums.\n--\nOf course, regular updates will also be released here and then, making sure to keep the game stable and adding constant improvements to functions and graphics, as well as interactions in the Germany map. We will also completely revise the AI system - we know it's you're biggest wish - and will take time to make Force Feedback better.\nWe hope you like our plans for 2017 and 2018 regarding Fernbus Coach Simulator.

I got myself close to the exit and basically gave up after trying everything I could think of to continue. Based on what I played, the game seems short and is vaguely creepy.\nOverall, Slabo is a lackluster experience, meaning it shows conceptual and technical merit but wastes its potential in every way. There's a good concept to this game: solve a maze in VR. Easy to implement in theory. I've seen it done in a spectacular fashion before. The visuals are creepy, but the limited lighting is equally as creepy as it is frustrating. Locomotion is limited to moving forward with the trackpad, meaning you have to look in the direction you want to move and cannot strafe or use teleportation. Roomscale is technically supported, but roomscale does not feel necessary at all and is limited to very small spaces inside the maze corridors or cage walls. The ways in which you move are poorly implemented and frustrating to the player. (I had 2 other people play this game and confirm that it is truly frustrating to move in the game.) There's also potential to get motion sickness from the game, though that's really not something I take issue with. What I do, however, take issue with is the inability to press buttons easily. The game doesn't press the buttons I point at and can be, again, very frustrating because of this flaw. It's a visual flaw as much as it's a mechanical flaw. You need to push sequences of numbers to unlock doors, but pressing the right buttons is sometimes seemingly impossible and can mean having to give up on the game even though you managed to figure out the numbers required because you keep pressing 6 instead of 9 for example.", "hours": 0.4, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "Syrsly", "products": 1124, "early_access": false}

I was looking all around and when I looked at the (non-existant?) ceiling I was stuck with instant nausea. There doesn't seem to be any option menus or if there are they aren't the normal button presses and aren't documented in the game.\nI might be able to put up with the slow turning instead of strafing but in conjunction with the HMD look direction move thing this game has currently I cannot play it.\nIf the devs remove that function or at least give the end user the option of turning it off I'll check it out again.", "hours": 0.1, "username": "MarikCraven", "products": 296, "early_access": false}

A few clunky aspects, but overall worth it from what I've seen. And o/c, still in Early Access, so bound to improve in quality (and cost) by the time of final release.\nGameplay: 7/10\nAI: 6/10\nUI: 5/10\nUnits: 6/10\nBuildings: 8/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nTutorial: 7/10\nCampaign: N/A as of this review.\nMulitplayer: N/A as of this review.\nOverall: 6.9/10\nThe game is, obviously, incomplete as of this review - it is still in Early Access. Gameplay is slow-paced, but lacks any form of tactical pause beyond the menu which prevents interaction with the game. AI for barbarians and wildlife, collectively referred to as \"hostiles\" is well done so far, they will retreat when losing and will attack on their own as well as defend their own home-base. AI for player units is also pretty good, though it would be nice if we had more ways to control them (a \"hold here\" or \"retreat\" option would be nice). AI for NPC empires is incomplete, they don't attack the player even if the player starts it. They will, however, defend themselves fairly well. It feels like the NPC empires don't have proper use of the game controls, honestly. Hurts playability, but not to a dangerous degree.\nFinite resources per island is a bit of an issue, but one I enjoy because it makes you ration supplies to a degree. Can't just build endlessly or you'll run out of building supplies. This is slightly negated by the ability to create and destroy islands - if you manage to get late enough in-game to run out of natural resources, you can just destroy empty islands and create new ones with limited resources on them. The buildings needed for these resources are all well-designed and overall both functional and attractive to look at. Some of the details could use work, and it would be nice to have more upgrades and larger towers, but overall it makes sense. Could use walls & gates.\nUnits are fairly diverse and well designed, with different abilities, upgrades, and a leveling system. There are also artifacts that they will, I assume, be able to collect later on, but those have not been fully implemented yet (or it's a bug, idk which). Units are divided into 3 classes: Melee, Ranged, and Magic. All units can be mounted on one of the 3 types of flying animal (ravens, eagles, and dragons) which can be gained by conquering their respect nest types and recruiting them. Mounting will happen automatically and cannot be directly decided or controlled by the player.\nBoth Multiplayer and the Campaign are still in the works, but I will update this review again once they have been released and I play them through. Only 2 of the 4 races are active as yet (Humans & Dark Elves) so I can't wait to see what the other races can do.\nOverall, this game is fun and has a unique premise with the moveable floating islands. Needs just a few more features (would be nice to steal islands from people, for example) and an AI upgrade for the NPC empires, but can't really say I regret buying it at this time.

And that\u2019s good.\nThere are a variety of levels with various enemies that come at you in patterns or sporadically. You need to be alert as sometimes they mix. What may start as a pattern could quickly end up a smorgasbord of death coming straight for you if you don\u2019t pay attention. Also, don\u2019t go willy nilly with the Pulse Cannon as the ring your ship is inside of indicates how much juice you have left to use it. Killing enemies refills it and there are tricks to use the Pulse Cannon indefinitely if you can kill as many enemies as you can and time its use. Killing enemies also changes your single shooter and upgrades it to a triple stream of death.\nYou can play with a keyboard/mouse or controller. I\nrecommend playing with a controller. It just feels a much more natural. Left thumbstick moves your ship while the right fires. Left and right bumper activate your Pulse Cannons.\nLow-poly make for lovely visuals as the colors are vibrant and the particle effects are great. The music is outstanding and I found myself moving and bobbing left and right to the music. It definitely fits the genre well and changes with and during each level, so it\u2019s never the same.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of twin sticks with a twist and swarms of enemies trying to kill you all at once, then Son of Scoregasm is deininitely one you shouldn\u2019t pass up. Coupled with challenging gameplay, sick beats, and pleasing visuals, SoS is a pretty good time if you don\u2019t mind dying a whole lot before coming up with the perfect strategy. You will die A LOT in the beginning, but once you master your Pulse Cannon timing, picking off packs of enemies becomes easier.

This is due to the face that you have two attacks, one with regular bullets, and one that acts like a proximity EMP. In order to score points, you have to first kill enemies using your EMP attack, which increases your multiplier, after which you can score points with your bullets, This leads to very interesting gameplay: while trying to survive, you also have to balance killing enemies with your two attack-types. How far will you raise your multiplier before going for the bullet-kill? It's the difference between simply survival and the top-score on the leaderboard!\nSoS is a fun, but difficult game.

It has fantastic variety in levels, and extremely good music.\nUnusually for a European made Shmup it has properly balanced gameplay and none of the usual mistakes that are associated with Western made shmups seem to be present.\nMy only very slight gripe is the ever so slight judderiness that your ship has when moving vertically, it's only very minor and the problem can be reduced by tinkering with the games aspect ratio.\nSo to sum up if you like these kind of games or just want to appreciate a game made out of love for the genre with great art and music, you should defintley try this.", "hours": 2.5, "user_id": "76561197994775497", "username": "blackswan77", "products": 183, "early_access": false}

Very cool and not bad for a free game but it would be served better as a short video.\nI'll start with the good.\nThe visuals are pretty fantastic (when you are only looking straight forward. I'll explain later)\nThe feeling of vertigo during a specific scene is very well done and helps put you into the mindset of your character.\nNow for my issues with this game.\nFirst and foremost are the controls or more accurately what passes for controls. Your actual hands and the hands in VR are almost never in the same place and I don't quite understand why there is such a huge disconnect. I wasn't trying to break the game by moving my arms super fast, I was getting into the movement system and moving my arms slowly to really feel like I was in zero G, but even then the in game arms basically stayed totally still and forced you to basically rip your arms back and forth in real life to get them to move even an inch in game. What's worse is the controls just failed within the first 2 minutes of the game when you need to leave a hatch and go outside the ISS. The motions that would make logical sense do nothing so instead you are forced to rip your arms up and down to force the game to do what feels like the opposite of what you should be doing to move in the way it asks you to.\nIt's really quite hard to explain, but it just feels terrible and incredibly inaccurate.\nThe game looks incredible but if you try to look behind you you're greeted with a black void where the back of your helmet should be. Its really quite strange, it seems like they thought nobody would try to look around and just didnt bother to create visuals for behind you. This shatters an otherwise decent sense of immersion (well, at least decent until you try to move).\nThere is a scene where sunset happens and it's done so poorly I cant imagine what they were thinking. They comment the sun is about to set and it just blasts behind the earth like it really needs to take a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Seriously, in about 3 seconds it traveled around 45 degrees of the earth's circumference and vanished never to be seen again. Would it really have been so much work to have the sun just barely visible and watch an actual sunset?\nWhat's also odd is the way the game handles arm models. Usually in VR you only see your hands and maybe a forearm but here your arms seem to just shoot out the sides of your head in a creepy and unnatural way. I tried ducking and moving my arms lower to combat this ear arm effect but nothing seems to work.\nWorst of all the game was so lazily put together they couldn't even make it end in a believable way...\n{{ SPOILERS AHEAD }}\nAt the end of the space walk, you are blasted away from the ISS and float out into space in a wild and uncontrolled way (this is the scene I was refering to earlier), it's done so well and it puts you into a panic because you actually feel like your sense of balance leave you as you spin into the darkness only occasionally seeing the earth. That's all well and good but they tell you to use a jet booster to get back to the ISS. This is actually pretty cool even tho it amounts to nothing but looking forward and pulling the trigger on the controller. The problem comes when you start to get close and the game just decided \"Nope, you've gone too far\" and suddenly you stop moving forward and just say in one place as the jets deplete. You're supposed to die and im fine with that, but why in the world would the jets just stop moving you forward when you clearly had more than enough fuel to make it back to the station? Just start me further back so that feeling of panic sets in as the station becomes bigger and bigger and my fuel gauge begins beeping only to just fail and not have enough fuel. Who thought it was a good idea to put you like 100 feet from the station then halfway just have the player stop moving forward till fuel depletes?\nEven as a free experience I cant recommend this game. Every design choice is more baffling than the previous one, from the creepy arms shooting out the sides of your face, to the terrible translation of controller motion to in game movement, to the sun that literally just falls out of the sky that would logically show back up in around 20 seconds if it continued at that speed, to the literal 45 seconds of being stuck in place to force the end scene. I just cant imagine anyone who worked on this game has even played a video game let alone a VR game before.\nWhat were they thinking?", "hours": 0.2, "username": "HeWhosKnownAsIAm", "products": 457, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Definitely a lot of potential. If it seems interesting to you, give it a try. The download is relatively small.\n\nA lot more fun than it looks! It's got good mechanics, definitely a solid ground to build from, and I'm excited to see where this game goes.\nA couple complaints, though.\n1. It's a little early to have DLC to the extent that it has, and as a relation to that getting the non-paid classes seems to take forever.\n2. Optimization, really would love to see improvement in this area, I get around 30fps, which considering the graphics and everything involved I think could be better. An option to turn the grass off would be nice as well, and could also help with this issue.\n3. Crafting requires products of trees and rocks. However, you have to pick just one tool to start with, so you end up having to scavenge for specific resources or looking for another tool. I'm not super crazy about that, but it's not a huge issue either, because the scavenging is fairly reasonable, and the other tools aren't impossible to find by any stretch.\n4. It's a bit hard and confusing to get into, the guides are a bit hard to understand imo. As well as this all the crafting seems to be done at the factory, so I don't know the point of the other places marked on the maps. Improved guides would be much appreciated.\n5. I'd really like to be able to hold RMB to aim down the sights, as opposed to being stuck with a toggle. More of a nitpick than a serious complaint, but I feel it's valid.\nOverall, it's more fun than I thought it would be, and I'll probably be playing it quite a lot. I hope it succeeds. I may at some point purchase the DLC to support the developers, but as it currently stands and with the way it is implemented feeling relatively pay-to-win, I don't think I will quite yet. I think they'd actually sell more if they consolidated DLCs into cheaper less numerous DLCs. Certainly, I'd be more inclined to buy.\nBut on the whole, for a free game with a relatively small download size, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't at least give it a go. :)", "hours": 25.0, "username": "mynameisMatthew", "products": 191, "early_access": true}

First of all it feels like there is not a lot of depth. As it is right now the island system feels kind of gimmicky. It's still a nice spin on things, though. The problem is that you only have three different heroes: Knights, rangers and mages. In addition to three classes of flying units you can get if you find their nests and capture (\"tame\") them: Ravens, eagles and dragons (each one better than the following). These can be mounted by said heroes. I played one game and I didn't really feel there was much replayability involved. Simply rush the nests, put heroes on the fliers and then zerg the opponents castle. However, I feel there is some potential here, and I hope it'll get better over time.

Please stop crashing though... -.-\nOkay folks, it's your friend Rascaldees here with another astonishing report from the Capital Was-... what's that? We can't do that because Bethesda is a sue-happy company and would probably sue us for doing that? They might sue us for saying that as well? And it's even worse because I'm still typing everything that I say?\nOH! Well, my bad then George!\nSo ladies and gentlemen (get triggered) here are the pros and cons of this game:\nPROS:\n1) Excellent concept. I LOVE this game and personally? I HATE most fantasy games of all types. I think fantasy is over-done. However this here game? It's easy enough to pick up and easy to overcome most obstacles while still being challenging enough to stay engaged. Also, floating islands are just badass.\n2) The controls are really easy to pick up. I can't stress to developers how important USER INTERFACE is. Quite frankly? The graphics could be the best in the world with the best story and the best... you get the idea. But if the UI sucks? If the controls suck and I can't understand them? I'm not using them. I don't like that to deconstruct buildings in great number (I often build a lot of turrets in games like these) you have to repeatedly click the button each time but... eh...\n3) The damned game just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing rocks. Support this developer. They're awesome.\nCONS:\n1) Okay, so there is a bit of a con here. I'm perfectly okay with 'hero' units as most strategy games have them. But your ENTIRE ARMY should not be only hero units. Personally? I think it would be damned awesome to see millions of soldiers fighting over a bridge that links two islands together rather than just a small handful of guys smacking each other. Numbers in a strategy game are part of the charm in my opinion.\n2) Economy can be a bit hard to grasp for new players. This isn't so much a con as other cons I've mentioned but... it is a con rather than neutral. I won't spoil too much here but your economy is based on having a certain number of people not working with others working and the former generating the cash. This seems... a bit backwards. Otherwise my neighbor should generate taxes in reality but he takes taxes instead.\n3) -sigh...- This is probably my biggest pet peeve about this game. Each individual building has a unit capacity. That's fine but... PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE IT SO I CAN RECRUIT A KNIGHT FROM ANY KNIGHT-BUILDING THAT JUST ADDS IT TO THE TOTAL KNIGHT-CAP! PLEASE! CONSOLIDATION! DO IT! OR I'LL GET SHIA LA BEOUF!\nSuper ultra mega horrible TERRIFYINGLY STUPID RIDICULOUSLY ANAL PROLAPSE CON!:\nI can't create a continent-battleship! \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s! I built a buncha turrets on a landmass, put a Wizard's tower lv 3 on it (my original plan was to use this island kinda like a \"tug boat\" for other islands that were just too far away to reach and then I was like... wait a minute...) and then built knight's doodads and marksmen doodads with their own farms (because I'm just weird) and such to that nature and had a mini-nation on an island which I was going to hurl at the enemy and laugh as they failed to comprehend that I could suddenly attack from anywhere!\nBut the turrets said 'no' as soon as I disconnected the bridge and this makes me sad. -100 points!

The main one that at larger airports (O'hare, Toronto, etc) not all runways are avaliable for planes to taxi too. It seems the reason is due to the lack of space. Perhaps, at these airports, the individual runway buttons could be shrunken down to smaller sizes, like in AMWE. Aside from that, I just hope more airports are added. In particular, EWR would be really nice.

{"product_id": "618710", "page": 1, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-29", "text": "Haven't played much yet, but as a big fan of Elminage Gothic I can already see I'm going to love Elminage ORIGINAL.\nA few quick impressions:\nThe translation is better than Gothic's so far, which is great to see (hope they continue to improve in this area for future ports.)\nSome convenience features are really nice for a change of pace from Gothic's brutal dungeon-crawling (mini-map with icons makes navigating the dungeon easier, and using the map isn't tied to a consumable item, so you won't get lost as easily.)\nNot a ton of settings to tweak in the settings menu but it gets the job done. Can configure a lot of small details in the UI, the speed of text in the game and more. I'm playing in 4K, which brings me to my next point.\nLike Elminage Gothic, the artwork and overall aesthetic of the game is gorgeous. For a PSP port that costs less than $10, I'm impressed. The wall tiles and textures are not very high res, but the portraits and character art are really charming and beautiful even if they aren't ultra high res. It's surprising considering the port is coming from a PSP game. (Turn on Supersampling AA x8 and force on every graphical enhancement in the Nvidia Control Panel. It actually makes a difference in how the game looks, even on 4K resolution, and the game will still run great.)\nThe music is also lovely. Has a sort of classic JRPG vibe to it, very atmospheric as well. And there is a feature where you can change the music in-game and put your own music in each location, etc.. Cool! You can do the same for faces and character portraits, too.\nAs for the gameplay, it's classic Elminage. Create a party from a vast array of character choices, dive through deadly, labyrinthine dungeons collecting tons of loot, leveling up, fighting devlishly tricky monsters and groups of monsters while trying to survive and piecing together the story from NPC encounters you find and bits of mystery you pick up along the way. There are many unique pieces of gear to find and use, many different types of monsters to slay, from Giant creatures to Insect creatures and even God creatures. Lots of ways to express your creativity in how you design and outfit your characters from the large amount of races, classes and loot you can equip, and more.\nOne difference from Elminage Gothic is that it's a bit more open. As soon as you finish the first dungeon you are free to go all over the map to many different locations (most of which you'll die at.) You have to collect Fame by doing side quests you'll find in the various towns, which you then use to power your Compass to help find the legendary Rings of the gods and save the world. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here, and the dungeons are large with a good amount of challenge, interesting things to find, secrets and more.\nI'd say if you're like me and a big fan of challenging dungeon-crawlers with turn-based combat, lots of party synergy and character development opportunities, fun exploration, looting, and survival/party management aspects in an RPG, definitely check this one out. And grab Elminage Gothic, too, if you haven't. ORIGINAL seems like a step under Elminage Gothic in challenge, so if you were put off by the somewhat brutal design of EG, this is an easier entry into the series, IMO.\nWill update the review later, possibly. Thanks for reading!\nP.S. Make sure to read the General FAQ and Starting Tips threads on the Steam forum! They are a must. Once you get deeper into the game you will learn it like any good RPG system, but you may also want to keep an eye on the wikipedia or look up information for the ruleset when needed.\nAnd feel free to read my exciting antics in the very first dungeon (essentially the tutorial dungeon.)

I guess it is the matter of personal flavor. The game has a fair amount of puzzles, and \"slightly enriched\" hidden object scenes, which are most of the time related to the item you have to achieve (not much of really \"random\" hidden objects).\nOne suggestion - the game could use some sort of stats, so the player knows where is he/she in terms of progress of the game, as well as how far the player is from certain achievement.", "hours": 6.4, "user_id": "76561198237177218", "username": "birdie2", "products": 12, "early_access": false}

There are several flaws:\n- The animations are not very good (although, to be honest, most of the HO-games have animations that look rather bad, imho).\n- The puzzles are laughably easy and pose no challenge at all. This isn't handholding players, it's pointing them almost directly to the solution.\n- A few times the item one needs is almost in the same location where they are needed. Again, far too easy to solve things.\n- The shortcuts via the overview-map don't always work very well. When one is in the wrong area (inside the house, for example), and the next action is needed somewhere outside, it seems that one has to walk outside first (to see the map belonging to it and the exclamation mark).\n- The story is horribly simple and doesn't make much sense. And the female protagonist must be the dumbest \"detective\" in the world. The story and the villains are recognizable from a mile away and her acting suprised about what happens is ridiculous. Plus, there's at least one occasion where you have to really question her sanity (opening a door when she knows there's a flooeded room on the other side).\n- The kind-of-philosophical ending with her gaining trust in herself doesn't make much sense. It looks as if it's being shoehorned onto the player without much reason.\n- Game is too short.\nAll in all I didn't enjoy playing the game, mainly for the lack of any challenge and the (sorry to say that) dumb female protagonist.", "hours": 2.5, "user_id": "76561198014403727", "username": "Mrokii", "products": 294, "early_access": false}

I'm a Hidden Object Game (HOG) junkie, so I've played just about all I can lay my hands on.  This game is published and developed by phime studio, LLC, which makes it a maverick and challenger to the dominant publisher in the field.  I'm so grateful to have those, so I'm biases from the start.\nThe plotline itself appears to have been truncated a bit -- they wanted to add more to the plot, but... time/budget pressures are always a thing.  Still, its a decent plot.\nThe 2D graphics are quite good and I enjoyed the scenery quite a bit.\nThe \"find the X key to open the door\" puzzles were decently connected to the plot (in direct contrast to AM's recent release where it felt utterly random).\nThe \"current goal\" and hint systems work well to keep you on task.  For at least the first half of the game, it is very linear -- you can't pick up items that aren't directly related to your next task.  No inventory full of 12 objects that have no current use.\nThe 3D graphics and animations aren't (in most cases) up to the quality of the dominant publisher's quality, but they work just fine. There's a few exceptions where I thought the 3D/animation was really good (water effects).\nThe music was pretty good, though a bit short, which can make it repetitive.\nThe puzzles were good -- a few new things for the HOG junkie.  Nothing terribly difficult.\nThe game engine is similar to AM's engine, but not as polished, which is to be expected.  But anyone who has played this type of game before will be instantly familiar with the interface.\nThe Hidden Object scenes were good.  I'm sick of AM playing with the format of them, so I'm quite happy that phime studio kept to the basics.\nIt's a bit short, I completed it in 3.2 hrs.

Well now you have your chance with Home - A VR Spacewalk. Aboard the International Space Station, you are tasked with assessing the outside hull for damages due to a recent meteor shower. Without spoiling the details too much, along the way an unexpected accident happens, and you must think quickly to avoid being stranded in the void of space; left to die of suffocation, hypothermia, or both. The title does house two game modes, easy for those who get motion sickness easy, and advanced for people like me who can stand flipping end-over-end out in space for all eternity. Both are similar, though the latter is just more dizzying,\nThis is the first VR game that has ever given me legitimate chills. As you pull yourself up and out of your little dwelling within the ISS, your hair cannot help but stand on end as you gaze up at the beautiful sight of Earth, 250 miles above you. It's not so much about what you're doing in this game, which is reviewing the ISS hull for needed repairs, but all of the possibilities that this short tech demo could bring; Alien VR, Borderlands VR, Red Faction VR? Who knows, but the possibilities are endless. Sure, it's not perfect and the gameplay is a little rough around the edges, but the experience is there and it's the first of its kind on Steam.\nIf you're wanting to get out in to the vacuum of space, then Home - A VR Spacewalk is an excellent experience. Just don't go in with hopes of it being a fully polished miracle, it was made by the BBC after all. That being said, the first time that you pull yourself up and out of the ISS, you'll be whispering a breathless \"wow\" at the amazing scenery around you. It probably could've done without the dark, and somewhat horrifying, twist, but that probably would've led this short experience to be a bit dull. It's one of the most unique free games available, so be sure to check it out.\nThe Virtual Reality Network\n|\nClick for More", "hours": 0.4, "username": "The Horror Network", "products": 2583, "early_access": false}

Controls are not great, hand rotation is taken into account as well as lateral movement along the scripted path, but not arm length variation with your ankor point, which again break the immersion. rotation of the hand does not rotate your body either.

Do you use a little more mana to chain together as mana islands as possible, risking fights with neutrals but snowballing your economy? Or do you use your mana sparingly, saving it for defense or when you need it most?\nSince the maps are proceduraly generated you will have to be adaptable to utilize what you are given as efficiently as possible and use it to steer your overarching strategy.\nThere are only two negatives. The first is the worker system is a little more dense than it needs to be-- which means as a casual player it is hard to forsee the shape your economy will take-- ending with you rushing to place buildings down as rapidly as possible with little thought beyond the next move ahead. With experience you will know exactly which resources you need for what but the lack of resource theme makes it less easy to catch on than the casual gamer might prefer.\nThe second negative is that the game is so good you won't want to wait for the next wave of features you know will be great!

Build cost does not increase when leveling up buildings; less is more Also there is no need to go beyond 2 Islands from your castle (The further away the more it costs). Farming is the only thing that hurts your income but after unlocking the Mill (unlocks literally in the begining) it becomes extremely easy to over power a few farms. Mills Stack infinately in my end gams I had 15 Mills and 3 Farms all level 3 and with the 20% bonus from the tech tree, supporting a population of 750. When it comes to the other resource you can just spam out Market places the more you have the cheaper the goods become just need allot of them to notice a difference. In the end I had only Farmers everyone else was gathering gold.\nAI:\nObvious they are not ready yet and spam way to many bridges.\nMagic:\nThe current magic is very abusable once you get you economy in line you can buy all the mana you need and just spam cast tonados to wip out enemy castles. Need some way to prevent spells from affecting your home islands.\nBlowing up islands was fun and was abused too.

When it comes to gearing the units you have to buy each piece of gear.  There is no retreat yet so your units either win or die during war.\nA word to the wise if you are like me and spammed wizards having 10-20 of them all casting spells (You need to buy there spells for them btw from the library) crashes the game.\n* End Game", "hours": 4.9, "user_id": "76561198024439208", "username": "Revelion", "products": 85, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

The only thing I could really fault in this game are two things.\nFirst - The Economy. The game is all about gathering resources gold, wood, food etc. etc. but there are only two ways to generate gold. You either have idle citizens or work a gold mine. Working the gold mine isn't really the greatest option though, as the idle citizens earn almost the same amount of gold if they weren't working. Everything in this game is reliant on gold, and the further away you build your islands, the more upkeep and everything in general costs. You can sell things at the market but generally, you don't get much.\nSecond - Hero units. The Hero units you get in game are not really heros. They are simply soldiers, mages and archers. There are scout's as well, but I don't really count them as a hero. Now you will find yourself in combat fairly early on, nothing difficult but bothersome depending on where your barracks are located as the units just simply have a nice stroll to fight the enemy. If you don't put a gold price on them though, your Heros only attack one at a time. The combat simply could use some work.\nNow apart from those two things above the game is great, but please don't take this the wrong way. The economy and heros are a different system but completely workable. The game play is solid, graphics are very pretty, music is good. Moving islands around and that sort of thing are great as well.\nWhilst I know this is early access, I do recommend this. At this stage, I would rate this a solid 8/10.

After playing a few hours, it is up to you if you want it right now, or in a few weeks after a patch. The review could also be thumbs up - but I chose thumbs down for now. See unit behavior\nThe economy is slightly (only) odd - achieving even a balanced economy is rather difficult, despite the small tech tree, as well as the quickly to grasp resource system ingame. You need to read/do the tutorial, to avoid applying mechanics of other games that do not work here. So READ or do the tutorial first, or discover your mistakes with low gold income ingame later, as I did.\nGenerating research points is, early acces test or not, rather insanely time and resource consuming, considering the use of research. 100 points for the first economic benefit, -2 building upkeep, needs more than an hour with one sages building. 60+ minutes for the first tech-tree update.... REABALANCE needed.\nThe tutorial is good, but slightly lacking at the explanation that range to castle increases upkeep costs. Furthermore, space limiting farms to often only one per shard, but requiring a manyfold in food per accomodation unit, makes expansion and extension/updates of upkeep intense farms a neccessity.  Getting some stone and wood then either takes a lot of time, since you can barely spare coin to use it on workers, or you need to wager your goods or mana in the market for needed goods. Let alone high level resources such as gemstones.\n(Destroyed a lot of buildings, and rearranged the islands as best as possible. Also learned that updates are a must for a balanced economy, same tier multiple buildings do achieve less considering the upkeep and input.  Also, after almost two hours, islands with resources on had no, and I mean, no access point to place the corresponding building. I discovered this when the first extractors had done their job and removed the deposits.) To sum up, bigger is better, the more high tier buildings and shards the more stable becomes your economy.\n(Game against AI on random/generated map with 2 of 4 mages/races available is the only game option I had - there will be plenty more)\nUnits are nice, a standard variety, massive spells and updates, all nice, BUT:\nsometimes, without any attack commands, one knight after the other goes rampage, on suicide missions to attack alone, while the remaining keep wandering around, then join the fight after all warriors are dead. Enemy levels up. Investing all resources I had, equipped a good party, full updates, tier III , and hey, the same number of enemies, though tier I-II level lower than my soldiers, pop up, and my soldiers and marksmen all die. Then the mage dies, not casting any healing spell at all despite having full mana and the spell... . After that happened for the third time, after one game of almost three hours, I rage-quitted. Units wandered into enemy AI killing zones on their own, dying and dying and dying, wasting all resources I had accumulated, and literally feeding the enemy. Trying to keep the units near my base was useless, and after the first try, I stopped giving them mount updates. Simply too suicidal. REWORK unit AI and rebalance please - greed is good, so they do the highest bounty missions first, but if there is no real quest, they shall not go on suicide runs. Also, considering the mount costs, the utility they provide is by far not worth the effort, and the vastly improved movement options increase suicidal tendencies.\nWhat I noticed was that enemy units worked better than my own, having a far better targeting priority for example. My knights stumbled around, only to attack the tank, while being hit for two minutes by several archers next to them. Bounties didnt change this at all. Finally, attacks on enemy territory are also suicide, because your units fight to death, or glory, and nothing else. Hence the enemy can cast spells on his territory, and you cannot, say goodbye to your max leveled heroes without anything gained.\nMagic is essential, useful, but: you have a fixed radius of casting-possibility. So, you need to build towers to extend. Updating the main building is extremely expensive, that is ok and inteded,\nThanks to Hamsterbryans comment, I realised that again I must have had bad luck that it didnt work in my game when I tried it out.\nSadly, these two flaws make this game, as enjoyable as it was, a bit frustrating and not unplayable at the moment. Let us be honest, if all your highly leveled and best equipped heroes go on suicide quests after you pampered them for hours, it is frustrating. I will update this once patches are done. (1 update)\nOptics:\nOn the graphics side, the game looks very good, altough it took a dedicated mid-to high end gaming pc more than two minutes to start, I think loading or compiling the intro was the issue.\nI had no glitches or bugs with animations so far, and I am sure the attack animations will be improved as well, but those that are are ok to good. Game ran without any fps drops.\nShard mechanic:\nreally innovative, well implemented, I think you can say THAT makes the game the most interesting. Animations, interaction, all looking great and well done.\nInterfact: Really good, intuitive, most information is well displayed.\nUnit rooster overview: nice feature, but you really get frustrated once they all go suicide-hunting\nUnit update buildings and updates:\nnice features, reasonable, really useful and needed, some improvements are somewhat redundant, but this is early access after all.\nThe fortress:\ngood idea, especially the fortify option, but some adjustments are needed because it feels somewhat unimpressive to have a bassive castle\nBuilding updates and general build animations:\nlike in the intro, very smooth and good looking. Seems really poished.\nFun factor (before massive frustration due to suiciders) was really high.\nAs with many games, I suppose there will be massive optimisations for hardware requirements during finalisation.", "hours": 4.8, "user_id": "76561198005409275", "username": "[WTFH] ragnar_greymane", "products": 937, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

A 2nd volume of 8 fantastic airports to play with, crash aircraft and get frustrated over. Then play them again and again and again! Because you're not actually frustrated with the game, but with yourself for failing hard!\nIn the first Volume the original 4 airports that came with Volume 1 were pretty good. As the game developed 4 more were added over time, showing a marked improvement in quality with each new airport release. Volume 2 alone is a collection of airports that showcases how much Big Fat Simulations has improved over that original volume. The airports are more detailed, more complex, and compared to the original airports, some here are huge!\nIf you're new to Airport Madness 3D, I will reiterate, this is an Arcade game based on time mangement and ever increasing levels of multitasking. So I recommend starting with Volume 1. The airports in Volume 2 are no pushover to beat..\nHong Kong is a good starter, but is very heavy traffic, finding gaps are easier, but queues will quickly arise.\nLondon & Nepal will test your time management skills to the limit. Every inch counts on a Single Runway where air traffic will be coming at you head on as you try to move aircraft back the way they came.\nChicago is the jewel in the crown with 8 runways to keep track of and aircraft coming and going on each. Multitasking better be your strong point. Crashes are a certainty, the very definition of Madness!\nAlso, more 'feature' content will be coming in the future too at no additional cost. This isn't just more airports at a price (which the developer deserves to be paid for).. There are planned features such as emergencies, night time play and more! So this is a game worth investing in as the developer is always adding new stuff through updates and patches.\nSo whilst Volume 2 may be more of the same gameplay, this is by no means bad at all..

{"product_id": "609150", "page": 1, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-17", "text": "Star Ocean: The Last Hope is the 4th game in the Star Ocean franchise and probably the worst in the series I've played so far in terms of story, characters and dungeon level design. As a long-time fan of the series who's played every single Star Ocean game except the most recent, it pains me to give this game a negative review. I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title and I didn't even look up other reviews & opinions on it beforehand. I genuinely wanted to like it. So what you're about to read is as unfiltered as possible.\nStarting with the port quality...it's playable...up to my standards at least. Stuttered like hell in fullscreen but ran perfect for me in windowed mode on maximum settings. Worked just fine with my xbox 360 controller. Didn't bother trying KB&M controls.\nI found the combat to be the only somewhat redeeming feature of the game but even that is bogged down by a very grindy material gathering & item creation system which didn't feel useful or even reach its full potential until after the main story is finished. Speaking of the main story there's a lot that goes on as one would expect in a JRPG but without spoiling too much some of the situations that happen in this game are completely baffling to me. I can't tell if it's just writer incompetance or possibly something lost in translation. There are some very illogical and downright nonsensical decisions made by our Hero and supporting cast that I just could not take seriously. And they were supposed to be some of the most serious moments of the game.\nAs for the roster of playable characters I couldn't find myself connecting with any of them. Most of the character's motives were pretty clear why they wanted to join the main group except for a couple of the characters. As for character development, outside of the Hero there isn't very much for the rest of the cast. They're one dimensional and spend a majority of their time affirming our Hero and telling him how such a good person he is. Reminded me a lot of how Tommy Wiseau wrote the dialog for the actors in \"The Room\" and how they treated his character.\nRegarding dungeons, the final dungeon was the only one that felt original while the rest looked bland and were far, far too long (just like this review). There are these elemental rings you find as you progress and they seemed to be the only interaction you have in dungeons other than combat. The rings only served 2 main purposes, unlocking sealed chests and clearing obstacles. You'd be hard pressed to find any sort of fun gimmick in a dungeon in this game.\nI put over 90 hours into this game and beat the main story. Of course I did an abundance of grinding/farming but it seems the game is intentionally built like that through some rather bad game design. Each planet you explore has resource nodes you can mine/harvest for items & item creation materials and the only way to reset them is to run back to your ship and sleep. That is a TON of wasted time considering how big the planets can be and how slow the character movement is (even with sprint). Lastly, the quantity of items required for most of the item creation recipes are obnoxiously high when you figure in the time it takes to get them. I played just enough to finish the main story and I have absolutely no desire to go into post-game.", "hours": 97.2, "username": "ArtificialRaven", "products": 1377, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "609150", "page": 1, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-13", "text": "Star Ocean The Last Hope is not a game you play for the story.  The story is bad, really bad.  Everything from the overraching plot to the execution of it's infintile dialog.  SOTLH is a game you play for the gameplay.  Might seem like the obvious thing to focus on when making a game, but a lot of people play rpgs specifically for the plot and can't handle a bad story.  If you are one of those people, stay far away.\nSo starting with the good, and it is good, the gameplay.  The fighting mechanics are fun and fairly unique.  In battle you have free run of the arena with the only limit to your regular attacks being the speed they take to execute, and the enemy attacking you first.  There are no action bars or wait times involved.  A core mechanic being able to charge up a dodge and timing it just right to allow you to sneak behind the enemy and get a free set of critical attacks.  You also have access to a number of special moves and magics that cost mp, but can be chained together to create large combos.  All in all it's engaging and very enjoyable through the entire playthrough, with new technics being interesting enough to want to continue pounding the enemy's force.  While far from reflex heavy those that prefer a more traditional turn based system might not like the level of constant attention every battle requires.  Beyond the battle mechanics themselves the game excells at giving you a real sense of progression as you increase your levels.  Not with the story, gods no, but again with the gameplay.  The special moves go from a simple series of sword swings and charges to giagantic arena covering whirlwinds of death.  All specials, magics, and skills can be leveled up independantly by spending special experience points you earn.  You get to choose one of three tactical paths called BEATs, two of which also level up and give nice bonuses depending on what your play style is.  Your weapons, which change your appearance in battle (some games STILL don't do this), run from a starting weapon of basically an electric saw to a lightsaber.  You don't just find this equipment laying around some dark dungeon either, well you do find some of it, but most of it you build yourself.  I'm not sure why, but for me knowing I crafted and customized the ultimate weapon gives me a greater sense of accomplishment then just picking it out of a chest.  Finally each of your characters have their own set of mostly unique achievments called tropies in the game.  These can be things like attacking first 10 times in a row to doing 200 squats (something that happens automatically when you land from a jumping attack).  Unlocking a certain number of tropies can unlock bonuses, specifically raising your level cap significantly.  All in all SOTLH really shines at making you feel like you start as a nobody and become an all powerful god.  Not because your background def and str score have risen, but because you aquire flashy new skills, weapons, and bonuses that slowely forge you into a godslayer.\nNow for the ugly.  There will be spoilers, but it honestly doesn't matter as this story deserves to be forgotten.  The problems with the plot and story design in general are manyfold, but I won't go into too much detail as I'm bored of writting this already.  So quick example, Earth just achieved FTL travel and you are a crewman on one of 5 of Earths very first FTL capable ships.  Your mission is to scout a planet for colonization, all 5 of Earths only ships...together.  Okay so predictably stuff goes wrong on their very first jump and all but two of the ships are destroyed, one of which is lost, the other being yours.  You then crash on the planet in question.  After some hijinks most of the crews deside to set up a forward base on the planet, and are promoted to captain and given command of the ONLY Earth ship with FTL capability (the other still being lost).  You are then given a grand crew of...two people (?) and told to...well you aren't really told to do anything.  Just sort of go out and have fun.   You are given no real directives beyond the extremely vague mission of scout out new planets to colonize as if this ship which likely took thousands of man hours to build was nothing more than a mere trinket given to friendly visitors.  So the plot is so mind numbingly unlikely it's actively infuriating.  Then the characters start talking and you will start to look for sharp objects with which to puncture your own eardrums.  From one character that constantly explains everything everyone else says as if there is a really inattentive child in the room who needs to be reminded of what just happened every 5 minutes.  Oh, and there is a really inattentive child in the room for most of the game that speaks in a monotone and says \"kay\" after every...single...sentence.   Early plot devices include the same exact sickness on two different planets affecting two different people and the need to find a cure for them.  Chasing down the invaders to an underdeveloped planet you just happened to land on (how is that in your job description?).  And a very short jaunt to a parallel dimension via a spontaneous wormhole that just sucks you up, and then magically spits you out when you are done there.  You get the idea.  The plot is trite, stupid, and boring, and the dialog is painful.\nMaps are decently large for the most part, and direction is rarely a problem.  The game is very linear with only 3 worlds, each with 2 or 3 dungeons.  2 dungeon worlds that can't be revisited, one of which is very small.   One very small world which is just a town and a dungeon, and then the final dungeon.  There are also 2 post game dungeons which are fairly large.  Decent amount of post game content, especially if you are a completionist.\nDespite the horrendous story telling in this game, it mercifully comes with a skip option.  So I would certainly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs that give them a real sense of progression and becoming a powerhouse as you go.", "hours": 26.1, "user_id": "76561198198916587", "username": "skott2424", "products": 9, "early_access": false}

As of right now the map size is massive but, its only a section of the full map. Idk if they have intention with  increasing the map size but if they do this'll create more of a chance to make other gamemodes. IT would be a really neat idea if they could open the game up to workshops and mod support that way, people can make there own mods and gamemodes to play.\nSome things that need to be fixed:\nThe biggest issue that needs to be fixed is the hit detection. It seems that many shots will hit the enemy but wont actually trigger dmg.\nalso its seems pretty cheap that its pretty much a pay to win with all the DLC.

Cuck!\nUpdate: I am friends with the developer so my opinions are biased and might be less negative than they should be. Seriously...it's that bad.\nUpdate: So I completed all the secrets and now I am ready to genuinely hate this game. I find myself being entirely underwhelmed. The real spectacle is the amount of work you are expected to do to find secrets rather than the actual secrets themselves. There was only ever one secret that was ever really \"worth it\" to find and that was \"The Sideways.\" The secret level which also happens to be the best level in the game and the only actually fun one with decent platforming.\nSpeaking of the platforming, It's generally floaty and you bounce around awkwardly so any precise platforming you have to do can become frustrating. It's also incredibly lacking in any variety of features. You can walk, jump, and climb and that's basically it. Everything comes down to \"Run at this. Jump on this. Climb up this.\" and it gets incredibly stale before you've even completed the story once.\nNow where the platforming mechanics fail you can expect the level design to hold up the rest of the game and make it somewhat interesting...right?....RIGHT??....WRONG!!! In the \"Dream\" half of the game, the levels are short and painfully linear. It basically comes down to being a walking simulator with the occasionally press of the space or left mouse button. Fpr the \"Nowhere\" town half of the game, you come back 3 times throughout the game to the same level with only minor, linear changes due to the story. The big problem with these levels come to the hidden secrets which are supposedly the big draw of the game and the reason it's priced how it is. With a little bit of ingenuity, the Nowhere town is left WIDE open and you will have 0 idea of where to go and you'll just get lost in what is secret and what is the actual story path. However the extra level is creative, entertaining, and has a clear direction of where to go but doesn't feel too linear.\nA big draw of this game to some seems to be the art. In the town the art can be charming and somewhat pleasing in a stylized way, but is overall plain and has the just the one boring color palette. In later levels the art style of the town is also brought down by rain and fog effects which do more harm than atmoshpheric good. In the dreams the art style, to me at least, is butt-ugly. The colors clash and the lighting effects just don't really work for them. The textures in the whole game are low detail and plain, but in the dreams they strike me as particularly repulsive.\nThe music does the job, I guess, but is overall just uninteresting and doesn't really get a strong reaction out of me either way. The score could have tried and captured the wonder of the dreams and the adventure more, but that may have required the game to also go more interesting places. All the sound effects lack any sense of punch and feel like just place holders.\nSo with all of the gameplay downfalls of the game, all that is left for it is to be a walking simulator with a good story, but for this game that is not the case. The story has a big sense of being up its own\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665the whole way through. It is fairly confusing yet uneventful and predictable by the end.\nAnd just because of how much time it took for me to complete this game I'm going to say how much I hate the secrets one more time........\nI hate the secrets in this game.\nThey are mostly boring and you get nothing but and achievement and sometimes a bit of narrative that no one cares about. The Toon glasses and Sideways are good exceptions but I only found those towards the end of my journey to 100%.\nI am overall annoyed and disappointed with this game. It would have been much better if the story was less predictable and went in a much more acid-trippy direction with the same kind of level design that \"The Sideways\" had. More creative and out-there ideas for level design would have benefitted the game greatly. Better, more, and greater focus on the platforming mechanics combined with creative level design, without all the worthless flab all the secrets bring, would make a good first person platformer in the same vein as Mirror's Edge.\n4/10\ntry again cuck.", "hours": 10.4, "compensation": "Product received for free", "user_id": "76561198140836912", "username": "Marshallangelo", "products": 130, "early_access": false}

The parkour and movement it is very...floppy? Floppy is the only word I can think to describe it.\nThe character doesn't have a lot of traction keeping her on the ground, which means sprinting up a ramp will result in broken legs most of the time. There were a few times where I was confused on where to go, but that was more me not taking any hints rather than the games fault.\nThere are multiple endings from what I can tell and a few achievements for finding secrets etc.\nThe story for the game was rather predictable, but the actual writing itself was well done, and made me feel a little sad at the main ending which is quite good for a game that took less than an hour. Some people may be saying \"An hour? I don't want to waste my money on that!\" which is a valid opinion, but I think if they tried to stretch it into 2 or 3 hours it wouldv'e degraded the experience as a whole.\nOverall, while the gameplay isn't the best the story makes up for it, and although it is less than an hour long if it was any longer it would degrade from the experience", "hours": 0.9, "username": "Icarus", "products": 193, "early_access": false}

I really don\u2019t The moment they decide to put their game up for sale, however, the leniency degrades and my palm slowly ascends towards my forehead. The frequency of the asset usage in Early Access is getting to high and I am tired of seeing poor programming accompanying it. The current amount of playable content includes two stealth missions that can be completed in under thirty seconds (with no clearing scoring method or failure state) and five run through portal missions that range from 30 to 60seconds depending on the walking or dash speed. I would say six, but the level seems to be broken and only has a CD_NAV prompt in the name. A story mode and other challenges are slated for a later date.\nVisually the game is what you expect from the Unreal 4 engine with sound design being standard door opening and footsteps. The two tracks I could hear in the game were okay, but with how quickly levels complete, I couldn\u2019t hear them to tell how long the track length was. The underlying problem is with how dark the game is in almost every section. One zone in a spiral corridor was fine, but the engineering areas and public zone were too dark. I have a guess why this might be, but I don\u2019t like to assume anything. As for the environments, I recognize the two stealth levels being made with the Modular SciFi: Engineer Hallways and some items being a part of the Sci Fi Industrial Crates pack.\nTechnical issues are wide and varied, including load screen issues (can move behind the screen), mouse functionality issues (loses the ability to scan by moving the mouse/requires holding down mouse button to scan), complete character lock up (causes character to not respond as seen in video with locked walking) and unexpected stuttering. This is not the complete list, but more of the serious issues. Missing textures make it possible to fall out of the level with a view of the skybox, enemy AI fails to detect you from two feet away in certain cases and the number of times code prompts flash up in the top left corner is unacceptable. I understand things like the story mode and combat challenges are missing, but you can make it so the response prompts are not visible or explain that the feature is not available. One glaring issue is with the equipment system that wouldn\u2019t respond properly in the Test mode, carrying over to the main menu. It adds another layer of frustration to the list requiring a restart of the program to fix.\nI just can\u2019t recommend it in this state and hope that the developers do manage to fix most of these issues within their first couple of patches.

Stop reading this review and go buy Driftland. Right now.\nI remember when Majesty 2 came out. I had such high hopes of a \"newer\" version of Majesty with deeper gameplay and better graphics. I drove 60 miles round trip to pick it up at my nearest EB. Unfortunately, what I got was a game that was kinda OK, but that had huge (to the point of extreme frustration) difficulty spikes from scenario to scenario (with no way of bypassing them). Even worse, it had no random map generator (which was one of the most replayable aspects of Majesty 1).\nDriftland wasn't even on my radar and came out of the blue, but it really feels like the spiritual successor to Majesty 1 to me. The biggest point of comparison to Majesty is that you build structures (such as a Wizards Guild) & hire units, but the units act independently. To get them to do tasks for you (such as attack a certain creature or explore & clean out an area), you place \"flags\" with bounties to attract them into action at that location. That game mechanic is pretty unique and while it might sound convoluted or overly difficult, it really works very well.  It's nice to have my AI guys taking a little initiative and doing something beneficial for me instead of me needing to control their every movement for a change!  :)  The one downside, is that they will often fight to the death, but this has been discussed by the developer (in the forums) and they're already working on a mechanic to address that issue.\nDriftland has a lot of features that Majesty did not. This is a multiple resource economy with gold, food, stone, wood, iron, etc., that requires you to build structures and to assign citizens to \"farm\" them. The land masses on the map are islands, floating in the air, that you have to use magic to pull closer to you and build a bridge/portal to be able to occupy/exploit the resources (an idea that I thought I'd really hate, but have grown to really like). There are other creatures in the game that you can defeat for their treasure stash or in the case of the giant birds in the game, you can take over their nests (which allows you to \"tame\" them, build them as units, and your warriors will independently mount them to become aerial units... Pretty darn cool!). The economics are somewhat of a balancing act of growing your population, growing your army, and collecting resources. It all works together very well. I could go on and on describing the game, but it has a relatively simple learning curve that's filled with discoveries and realizations. If you like this kind of game, you should go try it for yourself. I doubt you'll regret it.\nAt present, I'm only 7 hours in, but I have already gifted this game to a good friend. To me, Driftland is like a cross between Majesty and Civilization-lite. I know its early access and to some gamers (that have been burned before), that's like showing Dracula the Holy Cross. But to me, the game is already fun, the developers have been very responsive to posts, and I'm really looking forward to what this game can eventually become. Best of all, it's already scratching that Majesty itch that I've been waiting for years to scratch.

There are no orders. Instead there are goals. These goals reward money to the units that partake in them. Every unit for a goal costs 10 gold. Got an army of 60 units? Be prepared to spend 600 gold per goal.\n2.  After each goal is fulfilled, the units will return home. Be prepared for half of your army to be running in the opposite direction while you are spamming the next goal.\n3. You can't do attack goals on areas covered by fog of war. If your army doesn't move up enough, get ready to be annoyed.\n4. Your army doesn't amass. In fact, they are going to trickle in while the defender kills them off one at a time. There is no way to stop this from happening right now.\n5. Magic has limited range. You attack them? They'll be able to use magic. You won't.\n6. What happens when you are on a very, very large map and two players are very far away from each other? Like on opposite corners of the map? Get ready  to get creative to try and get your army to their base. With limited magic range, you won't even be able to cast anti-fog of war magic to order your units to their base. You'll have to send out flyers to explore. After this, how are you going to get ground units to them? Well, you won't be able to get the islands close enough to even connect to their base because they will be out of range. You'll have to really get creative. I know that after around 20 minutes, I finally found a path that I could use to connect to the last player's base and take them out.\nWhat happens if that last player doesn't develop enough? Get ready for a draw because they won't be able to attack you and you won't be able to attack them ;D.\nI'm not going to mention quality of life things like the UI as this game is early access and those elements can be improved.

As someone with rather specific needs out of a game, those particular options are important to have for me, and for accessibility in general.\nIt could also stand to have a pause button to allow you to place flags and such over a wide area, and to allow the player to think over their next move. It's entirely possible that there is such a button and I was simply unable to find it, though.\nNow on to the positive things. This game is very polished for a game from a brand-new studio. The visuals are well-done, the intro sequence is impressive, and the interface is, while not the best I've ever seen, certainly easy to use and I'd have a hard time picking out specific improvements that could be made (though I probably would find my grievances with it after playing for a while longer; but then, any UI is going to have its annoying quirks).\nThe one annoyance I had is that while you have to right click on an island to place a flag, if you want to place a flag on a unit (e.g. to order an attack), you have to _left_ click on the unit. I do hope these will be separate settings when the control config is implemented (you can't change controls at the moment, though there is a space in the options for it).\nAll in all, it's a well-polished, if unfinished, fantasy RTS. What's not to like? Fantasy themed games like this are rare.\n------\nOn to a few other thoughts, of possible improvements: The selection of races to play as feels a little limited. Humans, dark elves, elves, and dwarves (with the latter two being locked at present). I'd like to see a little more variety, particularly in the non-humanoid area. It's a fantasy game; cat-people and lizard-people are practically mandatory! More seriously, some other less-humanoid playable species would be nice. Perhaps a civilization of golems left over from the ancient war that shattered the world, or a varied alliance of beastmen races, from kobolds to lizardfolk to gryphons and centaurs, like Master of Magic had.\nSome more diversity in the existing races would be nice as well. I've been noticing lately just how many games have all white people, and I think some variety in the existing humanoid races would be good to see. Personally, I think the way to do this might be to implement sub-races (think how TES has Nords, Bretons, and Redguards, all of whom are human), or to simply give a random skin color to each unit (or random fur color, scale color, etc, if you add non-humanoid races to the game).", "hours": 1.0, "user_id": "76561198045554762", "username": "Felthry", "products": 194, "early_access": true}

I mostly wanted any form of info on who Infinite is (and even the comics made to explain him do a terrible job at it) or why the Phantom Ruby is in a new shape or why the Chaos Emeralds aren't ever mentioned or why everyone but Sonic is useless, ok I should stop this list before I pass out. But my point is this story fails to tell you much at all.\nNow for gameplay.\nModern Sonic feels about how he should\nyet in 2D his platforming is painful (and he's in 2D about 45% of the game). He has the Colors double jump but they nerfed it for some reason, making it near useless. Enemies are no threat and exist solely as boost fodder.\nClassic Sonic, everything, and I mean everything about him is wrong. His physics have no logic, he's sluggish on the ground but a balloon in the air. Some slopes he can't even walk over but rolling flings him 70 feet above them. His platforming would be challenging and even fun if he controlled properly.\nEasily the best part of the game is the Avatar, also known as Original the Character. Lot's of weapons and clothing to choose from, interesting platforming, and going fast while still feeling in control make him (or her if you make a female OC) the most fun thing in the game.\nI'm just gonna put both soundtrack and graphics together for this, because they're both amazing. Sad to say Classic Sonic's stage themes made my ears bleed though.\nLastly is the DLC problem, as Super Sonic is now paid DLC. Yes the form that was free whenever he was in a past Sonic game is now paid. You don't even get a Super OC, just Super Modern Sonic and Super Classic Sonic. Fortunately the other DLC's are free, but the Super Sonic DLC being paid is utterly wrong.\nDespite what I have said above I do recommend this game, because it redeems itself enough to justify a purchase, but do be warned it contains Denuvo Anti-Tamper.

The game has a very linear design to the point where you may even finish it if you let the foward and the boost inputs pressed. The sotry is something that seems that was dragged out of tumblr or deviantart and was lazily put together and the characters dialogue really feels out of place many times.", "hours": 10.9, "username": "Burmecian Dragoon", "products": 344, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "637100", "page": 2, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-14", "text": "This has easily become one of my favourite games. I really liked the story and the bond Sonic and his new 'buddy' formed during their time together. The graphics and visuals are absolutely stunning, to the point where I sometimes end up forgetting what I'm doing just to look at the backgrounds, and although the stages are pretty short, they're all very fun to play through. I absolutely love the soundtrack, though I might be a bit biased because this is my favourite type of music, I found it fitting to the game, especially the songs that went along with the avatar's stages.\nI love the avatar (although I'm not sure why they're significantly taller than Sonic), creating them and unlocking all the apparel to dress them up with, as well as their stages and gameplay. I did however miss the option to give them a name, even if no one were to actually call them by it. It would have been cool if their name showed up in the rankings instead of the name of your gaming profile (making it possible to search people up... Which is creepy).\nI didn't really see a real reason for Classic Sonic to appear in this game other than to please the Classic fans, but I still enjoyed his stages. Had some difficulties with his controls but it was alright overall.\nI love the Episode Shadow DLC, as well as being able to unlock Shadow for some Sonic stages on the main map. Loved the song remixes he got as well, though I wish his cutscenes would have been included in the theatre, or in his own separate theatre.\nSome of the challenge missions were really difficult to complete, although not impossible. Finally finishing all of them was an incredible feeling, but my heart goes out to the players with less fortunate circumstances.\nAll in all, I really do love this game for everything that it is and I hope everyone else can enjoy it as well!", "hours": 96.3, "username": "Hope & Beacon", "products": 48, "early_access": false}

A complete classic style RPG, 21 dollars. Maybe it's just me, but that really doesn't happen anymore. I actually had to remind myself that dlc costs more than games, and that it's sort of rude of me to make a statement like paying less for a full game when I normally wait so I can get dlc too.\nStar ocean is an rpg of sorts, akin to many other rpgs in its execution. Playing through the story gives you the tales of sort of vibe, interesting characters (though somewhat generic), Rpg like combat, (somewhat generic right now, usually it unfolds more later) And a story that feels like someone felt the need to make a Star Trek game. Which is really nice!\n-The presentation is probably the thing I enjoy most about this game. The story is just about as generic as you would expect. But whoever was behind the wheel here seems to have a lot of experience with making the best of bad things. Instead, it seems they made it a point to isolate what makes some of the tales of games great, which is putting you in the middle of these people's lives. Seeing and listening to how each character deals with situations and how they cope with fear is something you don't see very often. On the ship you get to see how a lot of them try to pass the time as well as what they like doing for fun. It is kind of why you can tell some of them are generic, but it is also what makes it more of an interesting experience. Older final fantasy games had this in the background, which is nice, but I like how much more important they made it here. (Again, so far.) I look forward to knowing the characters more, as well as how they behave in certain situations.\n-The Characters so far contain your typical young hero who is given a ton of responsibility he can't handle alone. Your childhood female friend who seems to need to make it a point to insure everyone knows she is a girl. Your typical human like alien friend, who tends to be more human than humans, which really gives off the tales of zesteria vibe. A robot scientist that is comprised of a mechanical body he made on his own, And he is somehow the most human of the bunch, albiet with an old hermit type of disposition... Which I like a lot! And a little girl who is pretty much what you would expect from a child, her personality is likable, but some of the things she does seems painfully influenced from the girl mentioned earlier. It's really a shame.\n-The combat... Ugh. Personally. I hate it. Some moves are clearly better than others. The base attacks are abysmal, and the combo potential is lacking for the most part. And the whole blindside mechanic is pointless because for most moves there is so much lag that if you are attacking, you'll be hit before you can charge \"jump\" enough to be able to use it. That paired with the fact that even if you set ai to freestyle all out, they still can't pull aggro enough to get enemies off your back, the targeting system is just not great either, it says it will target what you are facing... Sometimes you just get blessed with X-Ray vision and run clear past what's in front of you. Furthermore, the skill move system is just flat out bad. You can hold two trees, and those trees can hold up to three moves. each button triggers those moves sequentially every time. You can chain any special you want... most specials cause knockdown which makes only the biggest enemies impossible to hit. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO USE THOSE MOVES?\n-Combat wise... You remember what I said about the presentation? I get what they were trying for. there are skills and augments that make playing it a little more forgiving, as well as a bonus board tree that allows you to use specific combat feats to act as a multiplier for battles you face moving forward. (it resets every time you load into it, so don't touch the game if you want to play in short bursts) There are little modifiers to your basic attack that seem to work if you mess with the stick. Basically, everything that isn't like tales of is pretty great, but what is like tales of feels like a kid writing a paper wrong on purpose so whoever reads it feels like they tried their best not to copy the source by making it painfully filled with holes and imperfections.\n-Crafting is pretty cool, but depending on how adamant you are about finding and opening chests, seems pretty redundant early on. you won't really have materials early on, and more than most times you will find gear better than what your chest makes. All in all, the system is competent, no doubt it will be more fleshed out later as the game will have a hard time being difficult when they hand out money as much as they do.\n-Items seem directly taken from tales of games, but they stack in 20s. every item seems to do this. 20 caps everywhere. I think it's a double edge sword. On one hand, I will give 1000% more concern to item synthesis, because as items near 20 I will get uncomfortable, but the bad part is, you may end up creating weak or unwanted gear by carrying out with that fear. So when a new blueprint gets made, and you just had enough before you made junk... yeah, it'll hurt.\n-Save points seem to be on average about 30-40 minutes apart. Not the worst thing, but by the first boss I was already well versed in cheesing the game if need be. You shouldn't be dying unless you're running out of health or items... And if that's happening... Use the bonus board to fill your needs. Run away to break it, and build a better one. It's really a good system.\nIn the end... it's A fully featured 21 dollar rpg game that gives you everything and you can either figure it out, or use other systems to fill the gap. Story is alright, etc, but moving forward. Getting full games at this price is going to be a thing of the past, Laugh if you want, but I think I'm having more of a nostalgia trip for how much I paid for a full game than playing an old school rpg.", "hours": 12.4, "user_id": "76561198137728235", "username": "Xedhadeaus", "products": 1156, "early_access": false}

As it stands right now, I'm giving a tepid positive recommendation.\nThis game is very relaxing and chill to play.  The problem is that there isn't much challenge.  You use your hoe to till the land markers pre-determined for you.  That's really the most interactive part of the game.  It's not back-breaking, you just have to hoe it once {insert jokes}.  You can teleport around and turn with your motion controllers.\nThen you select the seed from your inventory and laser point towards the selected plot of land.  Then you can choose to water said seed/ growing plant.  I really liked the animation of the growing plants.  They are nicely done and you can tell after getting used to the visuals, when a plant is ready to be picked.  Unfortunately, it's picked the same way it's planted.  You point your laser towards the plant and *poof* it's picked and vanishes into your inventory.   Your inventory is your main menu basically.\nThere's a day and night cycle.  However, there isn't much different between day and night.  Night is darker, but you can always see and you can plant and grow plants in the dark without any problems.  So, I'm not sure if plants need light or not, I don't think they do.  I'm not even sure they need water, I think water may just speed up the process, but none of my plants died.  I did notice they grew at different speeds and I can only attribute that to my careless watering.  You fill your water container from the trough, even though there's a well nearby that you don't do anything with.  It would have been nicer to use the well instead.\nThere's chickens running around that you can scare away.  You can pickup eggs.  You can spend your money on furniture for your 1 room house.  I spent it on a bed, but then found out that's it's just for decoration, you can't actually sleep on it.\nSo basically you plant to buy decorations or for the fun of it.  But there isn't much if any challenge.  I guess you can lose by spending all your money on decorations.  There's no weather.  Day and night make no difference.  There's no setbacks to farming.  You're always guaranteed to make more money than you invest.\nIf this game fixes those issues and adds more challenges, this will be a very fun game.

It gives a beautiful view to behold, sadly though the earth is not fully animated so you don't get to see any moving stormfronts or cloud cover but you are treated to a quick sunset. You cannot move around freely and even your line of sight is rather restricted(Forced Camera Perspective). You can however turn your head around far enough to see the back of your helmet. Also you can't actually grab things other than the hand rails. A great little VR showcase that can be perfect for introducing a fellow gamer to VR. However I suggest NOT letting a non-gamer attempt this as a first experience due to the high level of vertigo could easily leave them with motion sickness which in my experience usually leads them thinking ALL VR will leave them feeling that way. The game does offer a mode that reduces the disorientation effect, it wasn't by much.

Existing software and hardware solutions are extremely expensive for audio polyrhythmic creations. See addendum.\n4. If anybody knows of software for visual polyrhythmic expression please post in the comments.\n1. The \u2018Gears\u2019 need to be more detailed to make this a truly superb sequencer \u2013 more choices of steps, better control over speed, polyrhythmic vs polymetric etc\u2026.\n2.

This list is very long and easily fixable, there is so much audio engineering talent available.\n1. This is so different than the linear approach in a video workstation that I believe one day its true value could be in rendering images and video more malleable to accompany music; think performance, advertisements, interactive experiences that could respond to user input.\n2.

It comes with a good selection of video clips, images and a comprehensive .wav sample library, but you are not limited to just these as it recognises a wide variety of audio, image and video formats, (meaning you can use your own content).\nThis software seems to be aimed both at people who have no experience with music production and existing creators who like to experiment with new approaches. I think that used to its full potential, some quite complex sequences are possible. Combined with the ability of the software for using any existing user content, the results should be very rewarding.\nStrengths\nVery intuitive, a new user can dive right in and start creating. The devs are also creating a youtube channel and set of instructional videos so a good body of reference material is being established for users of the software.\nEducational. Associating bars and loops with Gears and trigger points makes the process of building a music loop easy to understand.\nFun.  foreverloops comes with a library of > 200 samples and theyre pretty good ones, adding and swapping samples to hear the cumulative effect is a blast.\nFlexible.  You can use your own .wav sample library and images/video clips in your creations, making foreverloops a powerful tool with unlimited potential.\nProjects can be exported as audio-/video sessions.\nComprehensive, The program recognises a wide variety of audio, image and video formats.\nGreat devs. - When I purchased this I initially refunded because I found a couple of bugs and posted about them in the forum, and as the post wasn`t replied to for a few hours I decided to refund.\nI should have been more patient...

As others have said it is Foxhole in first person only with *slightly* less depth to the gameplay systems. It is a very good start and there is definetely enough there to keep you going for a while even though it could do with some more content like more building pieces, squads, automated defenses of some kind, etc.\nThe concept is fantastic. Scavenge and mine to build up your base's defenses or build forward operating bases on the frontline and move your team closer to the enemy base. Build a truck and run supplies for your team. Make ammo for your team. Change the tide of the battle by building a tank and go and assualt the enemy. Repair buildings around your base so you and your team can loot supplies easier. Blow a hole in the side of a building and use it as a sniper's nest. It is really a sandbox game.\nMatches can last from 15 mins to multiple hours depending on how well people are cooperating. The developers are adding stuff quickly and there is a lot of potential for this to be even better. Sure the graphics are rough, but the gameplay is definitely there.\nGive it a shot, it is free.

I recommend BUYing the SPEC-OP dlcs or the german spec ops and the russian army dlc, as the classes come with 2 tnt, except one of the russian ones with the svt comes with 3 tnt which if you  get good tent spawns one person can wreck a Base with-in 20mins-2hours or more depends if the Enemy team is looking for you and defends/repairs the base. TNT is the best option for damaging bases..so far that i can tell, unless you have a heavy tank and a bunch of ammo.\nThere are some bugs, shooting is great unless you move then your just about not going to hit\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.the closer they are the more of a lead you seem to need Some times my tent when placed to close to buildings spawns me in stuck to/ inside the building wall. takes time to craft tanks, its almost faster to loot from the houses, saves you alot of time but you still need to mining minerals.. the tanks arent to bad to craft its the extra fuel and ammo you need that cost alot.\nThe driving is funky, like some toy car that has no traction, friendlies with a biger tank can ram you and tip your tank or launch you into the air unrealisticly flinging you..no friendly fire\nYou can see teammates that are within mini map on your map, you also when aiming at them can see a small green outline on their bodies, which helps you know if its and enemy or teammate 300m away\nPretty Fun, It like rust and a heros and generals. theres loot and crafting. free game is great the pay just lets you unlock classes right away. Its quite fun i played 2 or so hours straight and still had fun.\nThis game is pretty fun and quick to download..you can mine wood and stone craft tents and walls and vechiles. matches can be 20mins to 4 hours.

At first its hard, i couldnt hit or see\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.but it grows on you..once you get use to the gunplay. spawn in chop some wood and make a scavtent as a mobile spawn for you..build a few and you can click on the one you want active as a spawn. can see and have shoot someone from 395m. Like a RUST FOXHOLE BATTLEFIELD, Theres ways to use vechiles in factorys to mine material faster, i have yet to build a vechile. had almost all the gear for a 20mm and right when i put the loot into my tent a enemy 20mm drove thro and blow up my tent, lossing all the loot and 20-30mins of work..lol. I will keep playing this for sure.. I can only hope that the playerbase grows.\nThere are towers to capture called locator towers which show a big red ping circle where the enemy might be located. itll show them within 250-300m. All Weapons expext the semiauto snipers and the two german specops weaopons, and 1 medium tank on each team. You get to play as the germans or americans for free.

This may or may not be an issue for people, I personally don't see the reasoning behind it.

I'm going with a tentative \"yes\" because this game can indeed scratch a JRPG itch, but it's not without caveats.\nPROS:\n* Has JRPG down in spades, with lots of skills, the blindside mechanic, and the general feel of combat and open world. Largely button mashy to begin with but it gets tougher, especially if you decide to ignore a lot of the encounters.\n* Interesting story. Not the best, but it's cool. Ties in an interesting \"what if\" scenario for our own Earth that had more potential to delve into than they gave it, but a B for the effort.\n* This might sound odd, but I've always found Star Ocean's sound and music direction satisfying, right down to the little clicks in the UI. That last bit might be nostalgia talking.\n* A good port. I've had no issues.\nCONS:\n* Boring, one-sided characters, some of which are so bland, the comic-relief characters (i.e. anime tropes) feel forced in there. Every time Lymle says \"kay?\" I want to snap her neck. Cat girl is hungry all the time, we get it. Edge is CRAWLING IN MY SKIN. Raymie has no personality.\n* Very, very poor quest direction, sometimes almost none at all. It's like the game wants to make it a point for you to look through every nook and cranny of its dry, boring world. Which is also to say, there are side-quests from random NPCs and items that you may miss out on, with no indication that they had something for you to do other than your standard \"I'm an NPC and I say this!\" thing. No map indicators or arrows for quest direction, nothin'. Frustrating, to say the least.\n* Can't pause cutscenes. This wouldn't be an issue of they weren't so damned long. You can skip them, sure, but coupled with the poor quest direction, you might miss something if you skip it. (I should add though that if you skip a lengthy scene, you're treated with a brief synopsis immediately afterward. You can also look at the journal for some direction, but it often just leads to more questions.)\nLong story short: worth it on sale.

Well, it's true. There were moments where he handled like Stephen Hawking with the parking brake on, and other moments where he took off like Usain Bolt if you swapped his Splenda with crack.\nI'm going to be perfectly honest here. I'm a university student and for one of my projects, I chose to make a 3D platformer. Now, bear in mind I had no idea how to do this, it was outside my realm of experience. Despite this, and despite my rather short development time, I came up with physics and character control that was objectively better than what Sonic Team accomplished here. My first playable debug build objectively had a more realistic approach to gravity and momentum than this nightmare.\nThat's not only embarassing, what's worse is these people had access to the source code of Generations and other boost formula games where the physics was done correctly. I don't believe the engine has changed so this c*ck up is inexcusable. These people literally had every tool to get it right and failed. I wouldn't trust them to make ice cream without starting a house fire.\nIgnoring the physics for a moment, another thing, the stages are really linear. You can't claim to offer different ways to move through a stage by putting one identical set of floating floor panels above another, that's the platformer equivalent of a soviet apartment block.\nMoving on, the stages are way too short. I'm in no way a fast person, when I drive people call me Windows Vista because I take 6 years to get anywhere and inevitably crash. That being the case... why are modern sonic's levels taking a minute? I know the speed means stages are larger than they appear but Sonic Unleashed made every daytime stage a minimum 4 minutes for the average player. That was a decade ago.

{"product_id": "734580", "page": 8, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-01", "text": "BattleRush is a neat little WWII-themed FPS, often likened to a first-person version of Foxhole. It involves platoon-level combat between players who work together to destroy the enemy's base while simultaneously gathering resources to build vehicles, fortifications and emplacements. However, this game is still in very, very early development and suffers from a multitude of issues- but once they are overlooked, BattleRush shines as a pretty decent multiplayer FPS filled with potential.\n-Decent gameplay, controls are easy enough and the actual firefights, when they happen, can get quite intense.\n-Mostly destructible environment, buildings will fall down, trees will topple.\n-A large variety of vehicles and structures to build.\n-A massive and very pretty map allowing for very unpredictable (and audacious) manoeuvres.\n-Poor optimization, but option menu gives you only three graphics settings (low, medium & high) that just change the vegetation as far as I can tell\n-Confusing and unnecessarily flashy UI written in broken English, looks like it was made for a mobile game (should be solved in future)\n-Lack of variety, (gamemodes, sides etc.) but again, this should be solved in the future\n-Several powerful classes (machinegunner and bazooka dude among others) are purchasable DLCs, adding an unfortunate P2W aspect to the game.\n-Strange realism choices (map is realistic, but the soldier models look super-cartoony, grenades are laughably ineffective, no optics etc.)\nHowever, given how early in development this game is, these issues should hopefully be sorted out soon.\nSomething important to note about BattleRush is that the huge map makes games super slow-paced, much like a simulator (only a lot less realistic and tactical). If you want to charge into enemy lines proudly shouting 'URRAAAAA' with guns blazing while a bass boosted version of the Soviet National Anthem plays in the background, this game might not be the best choice for you. Otherwise, if you're a WWII enthusiast, an FPS fan or just looking for something free to pick up and play through the weekend, BattleRush might do just the trick!", "hours": 8.7, "username": "clueless idiot", "products": 7, "early_access": true}

It was an idear of my friend AvixHyuuga to play this game on an early morning. Best idea of 2017 it seems! A game that wasn't as gimpy as Heroes and Generals, but rewarded the skill just as much -- to an extent. I'll lay down some pros and cons.\nPros:\n- The F2P classes are still just as good, and even preferable in some cases!\n- Requires team coordination. Playing with friends is beneficial.\n- The Scout Cars are a meme. @AvixHyuuga\nCons:\n- Moderators need to practice what they preach. Telling kids to \"shut up\" does not solve problems, it only creates more.\n- Comms channels are dead or filled with non-English speaking insults (you know the ones...).\n- There's no dedicated in-game voice channel for the teams.\n- There's no balance with class choice, so most teams end up being AT Infantry only.\n- Glitches and bugs still exist, which are exploited quite often by players that know them.\n- Some of the P2P classes are somewhat overperforming, especially the Special Forces and Elite AT Infantry classes.\n- There's not enough people playing the game to populate the servers!\nAll in all, this game suffers from most EA shooter problems, and sadly the same community issues, but is still fun to play with if you just play with your mates. Can't say the same about anyone above player-level on the heirachy though. The dev should review their moderation team and get some experienced moderators on their side before the community hangs up their coats on them.", "hours": 47.9, "username": "[RKNi] Dustii.Logistics", "products": 61, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": true}

Here lies another example of a steaming piece of sh\u00edt that's far from being finished, let alone playable, yet already reeking of Pay2Win.\nBasically after no introduction or at least an option to bind keys to your liking you're thrown on a battlefield to... I dunno, supposedly win a battle, I guess. It's not easy tho, cuz' unless you paid, your equipment is close to useless, because while everyone else has submachineguns, sniper rifles and RPG's, you run around with a d\u00ecck in your hand that's doubling as a \u0441ra\u0440\u0440y bolt action rifle. When it comes to shooting mechanics, it's simply one of the weirdest I've seen, and I've been playing shooters for ~20 years. It's often easier to hit a target 100m away from you than someone standing right infront. It also seems that damage dealt is calculated from current air humidity, cosmic noise and global birthrate. One time you one-shoot people at insane range, the other time you headshot a guy three times in a row, then he turns around and does you 115 damage with a frickin' pistol. Bullets have no dropoff or aim deviation and there's a sort of an aim helper that makes it possible to shoot three-pixel large targets - and that's what everybody's doing.\nGraphics is bad. Don't get me wrong, there are games stilized to look in a particular way, but it's not the case here - all the textures are dark, obscure, blurred and indistinct to a point where it's really hard to tell a friend from foe. Sometimes it's even hard to tell what the hell you're looking at. At greater quality settings there's also a shader covering the whole screen which makes everything look even darker and blurry. Tracer bullets, give off a faint light of the same radius, no matter the distance or angle, making them nothing more than a useless, annoying distraction. Sound is equally awful. Most guns even from different factions have the same sound, therefore it makes it even harder to distinguish friends from foes, cuz' you can't even tell who is shooting at who.\nEvery construction on the battlefield can be destroyed, which is actually nice. There are also building features, tho you need to have materials, which you can get from... cutting down trees and digging stone and minerals? Really? I mean I know the resources need to come from somewhere but who in their right mind has time to cut trees or mine stone when there's a war going around and bullets are flying above your head? Inside buildings all sorts of loot can be found like building materials, guns or food. Most of those things are useless anyway, as building materials come in small quantities, so you'll still need to cut trees or dig in the middle of a warzone; guns (often sh\u00edtty) have very little ammo, so there's no point in using them, unless you picked up and dragged along a proper ammo case from elsewhere; and food - it restores health, but since 90% of the time you'll die from a single shot, you propably won't have an occasion to use it.\nOverall during the battle noone seems to know what the f\u03c5\u03f2k is going on, nor what should they do. There are barely any objective pointers or indicators of what is happening. People are doing completely random stuff - some throw grenades on themselves, some think it's Minecraft and build random structures, some camp in bushes killin' everyone and their grandmother, and some just drive around aimlessly with some kind of hard-to-tell-vehicle. The game's either a clusterf\u03c5\u03f2k, where you spawn just to die a few seconds later, or a walking simulator, where you spend five f\u03c5\u03f2king minutes to get on foot from point A to B while dragging a backpack full of needless sh\u00edt, just to get shot from nowhere, die and start over again.\nI know the game's alpha-quality. What bugs me, however, is why developers are so insolent in putting in paid content while still waving the ALPHA flag as if nothing's wrong. Right now the game needs a\nof work to be even playable, because let's face it, in its current, half-broken state it's just a sore experience and an irritating waste of time. There are missing basic features like keyboard binding settings, graphic settings or even some true form of a tutorial, cuz' just linking to a forum post or whatever counts in best case as sloppy half-a\u0455\u0455ery.", "hours": 1.9, "user_id": "76561198021684346", "username": "Junne", "products": 64, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

The actual content of the game requires roughly one and a half hour to be fully experienced. With that said, this is a short game, which I have no problem with considering it was developed by a small team and it's reasonably priced, but the regular crashing and the buggy saving mechanism just made the whole experience excessively tedious and completely ruined my positive first impression of it.\nIf you're really into atmospheric \"walking-sims\", I do think you should try it out and you would probably find it interesting, but I suggest you wait until it gets a couple more updates to avoid frustration and your time being unnecessarily wasted.\nApparently the devs plan to release a series of episodic sequels of Fariwalk in early 2018, as far as I'm concerned, I hope they could do a little more playtest before putting their products on the market. Nevertheless, with technique issues aside, I do like the artstyle, the world design, the atmosphere, the ambient sound, and the occasional spookiness of Fariwalk, and I'm looking forward to the future works by AIHASTO.

It seems like a friendly game until some ugly abomination begins to chase you through the dark forest. Although it is not much of a horror the use of visuals and sound effect created a very chilling atmosphere. At the time if this review the game has a lot of glitches but for $2 I can overlook it because eveything else is awesome.\nApparently, you can encounter items that you do not need yet in this version (this is a prelude to a bigger game)The game tends to crash infrequently but seems to be well optimized at least on my end. I also run into couple glitches that required me to restart. English version still has some russian words.The quest progress was not tracking properly. Beside technical problems it also needs more intuitive tips.\nIt feels a lot like a walking simulator but you get mini-games, cutscenes and sometimes have to run away from a monster. Although there is a lot of walking you will likely feel motivated because there are a lot of things to look at. Despite being an introduction to a game you can easily drop 2-3 hours exploring which is a good deal for the price. There are 4 unique quests that have multiple objectives. Around the relatively small area, you can also look for collectibles and secrets. Puzzles were relatively creative but were not as intuitive as I would like.\nI specifically enjoyed the use of sound effects and ambiance. I always felt like something was happening around me that created a spooky atmosphere. Even though the environment is very foggy there was enough detail to enjoy exploring. It has all kinds of creepy creatures and even some jump scares. We meet several interesting characters that I like enough to possibly draw them in the future. Overall the game just nailed the immersive world.\n\nFariwalk:The Prelude is a great start to an amazing game. If you into dark fantasy and walking simulators I think you will enjoy it. I did not expect that kind of experience from a $2 purchase (usually you get a 3D map asset)  Love the characters, aesthetic,music and creativity. If this is anything like a final game it could be one of my favorites. -Thx Dodger for finding this!\n...........................................................................................................\nFor more hidden gems:", "hours": 3.6, "user_id": "76561197995669628", "username": "Sorokonojka", "products": 757, "early_access": false}

The characters all are so one dimensional and has no redeeming qualities, just straight up cardboard cutout. It's like the characters designer went into a DnD character randomizer and BAM we got our party. Honestly do the characters have any mind of their own besides being there to boost the ego of the main character Edge Maverick? (Yes that's really his name). Watching cut scenes all i can think to myself is \"don't choke sucking his\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665too hard now.\"\nMusic: Forgettable. It's not bad, but it's not good either.\nGameplay: So this is probably why you would want to buy this game, for the combat. But let me tell you even the combat in this game is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed. They introduce a system where you can time flank your enemy, but guess what? if they do an attack that's remotely close to you while you flank you still get spank. The biggest offender to me has to be the camera, like seriously how can you have action combat and can't even manually target who you want to hit? Playing melee in this game is garbage, one minute you're trying to attack an enemy that's literary right next to you, all of a sudden your character runs across the map trying to hit someone else, like WTF?\nPort:\nThis port is so freaking lazy, if you have your monitor at over 60hz refresh rate you have to change to 60hz every time you play this game or else you get micro stutters. God forbid you leave it at 120hz and the game runs at 2x speed LOL. Not to even mention the plethora of problems people are having in the community hub, this is 2017 don't call it a remastered if you can't even get the basics.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nPlaying this game is like a test of patience, I can deal with so much before i get offended, and that's basically how i describe playing this game, it mocks your intelligence and offends you. This has got to be one of the worse games I've ever played, and I've played tons of games and jrpgs.

The previous game had a much more even cast of masculine and feminine characters. This game only has two masculine characters, 6 variations of feminine characters and a cyborg that wishes you only think of him as a common electrical appliance.\nThe crafting system isn't as good as the previous title. The combat system? It's ok. I like this series combat system more than the Tales series and this game still holds to that but...\nThis game fluctuates between really bad and bizarre in its story. At least with Star Ocean 3, the story was coherent for about two thirds of the game before falling apart. This game just fell apart right at the start. **spoiler**\n\nThis review ends to talk about Lymle, the fourth party member.\nLymle Phi Sucks Rant:\nI am not sure what the design idea was to include the character, Lymle Phi, I am assumming it was an attempt at adorable. But she is creepy, forced, and miserable in every cutscene. The way she was introduced, and so early on in the game (about 2 to 4 hours in), is awful. The whole sequence of events was awful. From here on out, she will be in every cutscene adding the most awful cutsie-wootsie dribble to every occassion that just trumps everyone elses awful dialogue. Here is an example:  Edge \"The universe is in peril! We have to plan what to do next.\" Lymle \"Look I drew with crayons on the deck of the bridge, kay\". Every cutscene, similar dribble. **spoiler**\nStar Ocean 3's Roger Huxley was a much better character that filled a similar trope to Lymle Crapbasket and on top of that, he was optional. The game didn't force you to go on thieving raccoon person adventures with Roger to prove he was the bigger man in his village to his own seperate antagonist. But you could. The game offered an amusing juxtaposition of a character trying to prove he was grownup by doing a bunch of little kid dares to prove how brave he was. But with Lymle, no, you have to watch that toddler bit woven into EVERY cutscene after you get her. Also, Roger had the mentality of a 10-12 year old and his character bios says he is a 12 year old. Spot on. Lymle? Her bios says she is 15, which is 2 years older than the de jure age of consent in Japan. Her mentality? 3 year old. Her actual physical appearance? 6 year old. Screw you Japan.\nConclusion:\nI was curious to see if this series got any better after 3.

This feels like a fully finished game which is a steal for the price it's currently going for.  (TL;DR: BUY IT!)\nGraphics are stunning!  Music is beautiful and soothing!  Everything runs very smoothly even on the highest settings on my not-so-fancy laptop.  No lag issues, no crashing issues, even the built-in auto save doesn't cause any problems.  I came into the game expecting to see some hiccups here or there, but have yet to find any.\nThere's a nice variety of resources to find and utilize.  It is interesting and challenging enough without being so challening you can't keep up with balancing everything as you expand your empire.  Resources will deplete so you'll have to conquer new islands to replenish them and sometimes finding the right island is tough.  Thankfully, the option to magically add the \"perfect\" island is a nice feature to make sure you get something useful.\nManaging your workers is SO easy in this with the little dropdown menu at the top left.  No more Northgard-style clicking on workers then buildings to reassign them; just click the '-' or '+' to move workers and citizens around to wherever they're needed.  This alone is a fantastic feature that makes gameplay feel so smooth and enjoyable.\nThis may FINALLY be the \"new\" Anno 1602 I've been looking for all these years.  It has some elements reminiscent of the Civilization series but progresses a little faster without requiring you to sit down and pour hours into the game.

I had my doubts about the quality.\nTL:DR\nIt's a great game at an affordable price, that feels like Northgard and Majesty had a baby, but that baby will one-day grow up to be better than its parents. (And the baby has a hobby involving sticking islands together, which is awesome.)\nFirst off, I'm going to go ahead and say that the quality I'm seeing, is on par with Northgard. If you're not familiar with Northgard, keep reading.\nDriftland is like a beautiful mashup of (I'm going to say Northgard again) and Majesty, with floating islands that can be bridged together to create a kingdom.\nDriftland fulfills all the 'promises' that it seems to make, with its description and the overall premise. Floating islands can be smooshed together to create a kingdom, the economy in the game is fluid, but easy to figure out, but is also has depth that allows you to approach it in a few different ways. I wouldn't go as far to say that the economy is settlers-like, but again, I'd say it's more like Northgard in that you have to play a balancing act of where your people are gathering, what they're gathering, and making sure they're fed.\nThe more islands to 'bridge' together (witch actual bridges) the more your empire grows, the stronger your economy gets, and the greater your military potential. With each island, you actually feel like you're becoming stronger (and on a normal-sized map, I felt like there were plenty of islands, but not too many.)\nI was a little...iffy, on the combat, at first glance. My troops (which are majesty-style, in the sense that they do their own thing unless you set a flag to send them somewhere) were flooding one-by-one into a nearby AI controlled territory. I didn't know what to do to stop that from happening. Just-so happens that those bridges I mentioned, were able to be destroyed. So you can cut-off another player from their own islands, by destroying their bridge. You can build towers to protect your own islands, but...the AI can still just re-make the bridge, which brings me back to the problem of my units flooding in one by one, if they have access. So, maybe that'll get worked on during development.\nAside from the few oddities with the combat, I can't find any issues with the core gameplay, after 2 hours of play time (which, you don't need much more, to figure out if the game is solid or not.\nApparently a campaign is being worked on, as is multiplayer. I think the game (in its current state) would totally be worth a $14.99 price point, but it's currently $17.99 on sale, with the default price being $19.99. Once the game gets a campaign, its last 2 factions, AND multiplayer, it'll easily be worth $24.99. So, currently it's not quite a steal, but pretty close.\nI did not receive this game for free, I paid for it, I don't have any stake in giving this game a decent review.

It looks like the campaign mode is missing, bridge upgrades, certain building upgrades, etc.\nWith that being said, I loved the old Majesty games, this feels very much like an updated version of it with cool new features.  The biggest of which is the island gameplay.  You move islands into your realm and harvest them for resources.  You can also build farms for food and cottages for people resources on the islands.  You are also able to create new islands and destroy old.  It is a really interesting gameplay mechanic bringing island resource management into play.\nGameplay is pretty fast and doesnt feel like epic 4x games.\nPros:\nThe UI is easy to navigate.\nGameplay is fun already.\nI love the Majesty like gameplay.\nIsland play is an interesting mechanic.\nCons:\nObviously still in early access.\nSome of the upgrades seem too easy to unlock / quick to unlock.\nNo real camps of monsters to level up your characters on.\nAI bugs where units got stuck, and a few crashes happened.\nNo way to make groups of characters that I could find.\nOverall I would say its close to the early access price worth of fun.

Everything feels polished and great. The animations are hit and miss, as could be expected from a smaller title with a smaller budget, but never feel bad, just limited.\nAudio is competent and overall fitting, but here as well you notice the limits of the developers size, budget and resources where it just stops short of great, but again - never dips in \"bad\" or even \"sub par\".\nWhere i find myself struggling with the gameplay is mostly in the balance and pacing. With the start of the matches being a frantic race for control and exploration of resources, it quickly stagnates and doesn't resume when your economy, resource allocation, combat and research (still a work in progress) all grind to a halt and you simply stand around and wait making baby steps in any direction.\nThis isn't helped of course by the fact that it takes quite a while to find your opponent in the floating islands, and that results in combat being less of a strategic element, and more of a reactive \"lets see where their magical teleporter gate pops out of\" affair.\nThis is in my eyes the part of the game that needs the most attention in terms of pacing and balancing overall. all the pieces are there, they just dont fit together that well yet.\nIf you enjoy the review\n.

Overall, this is a surprisingly solid port without the usual weird glitches from porting console games to PC that I've usually experienced in the past.  This might be due to the fact that it was remastered but I couldn't say for certain.\nThe Game itself:\nStill follows the same generic JRPG formula of building your party with a typical quest to save the world/universe.  The dialogue is slightly above average and being able to turn on Japanese voices was a huge plus because Edge's and Welch's voices were driving me insane.  (Welch sounds like Lil from Rugrats to me)  If I had one major complaint about the game it would be the horrible camera during battle and the semi-automatic style combat.  Once you get used to the combat it's not so bad, but it doesn't feel as good as say the Tales series of games which use the same Action Battle System.  As for the camera, well, switch it to fixed in the Settings and it's not as bad.\nLove how the game gives tiny bits of fan service with Reimi's butt during her victory animation, you can tell this is made in Japan...", "hours": 84.7, "user_id": "76561198020729018", "username": "ZeroGman", "products": 286, "early_access": false}

I pumped about 500-600h into this game back in the PS3. If you like JRPGs, this is definitely one of the best you can find on Steam. The combat system is amazing, great soundtrack, a complete crafting system, decent character customization options, and plenty of side stuff to do (side-quests, battle trophies, data collection...).\nThe story is its weak point but only because the ending is a bit weak in my opinion (until very late in the story it's pretty good though), but when you start playing the post-game content you'll soon forgive them for it. Chronologically this is the earliest game in the series, so it's great for people who are new to the franchise, and there is a Dictionary in game that will expand the lore, if you're into this sort of hybrid fantasy/sci-fi (imo it's awesome).\nThe port runs very well, even though I have a modest laptop, I only experience some fps drops during blindside animations in bosses (not bad for an integrated GPU) and so far I haven't experience any crash/freeze or similar. Technically near perfect as usual with tri-Ace games, with almost instant loading times which are just a blessing.\nIn summary, buy this game, you'll definitely get more and better content than the price tag would suggest. And please Square-Enix remove the 4K Full HD Blah blah from the title, it looks ugly, and I get on my knees and beg you to please also port all the previous Star Ocean games (don't bother with 5, it's not representative of the quality of a Star Ocean game, or a tri-Ace game), and also the 2 Valkyrie Profile games and Resonance of Fate.

I'm still trying to find out what flavor paint chips they were eating when they said these lies.\nI'll start with some positives:\nThe port is fine, long as you don't have anything higher than a 60hz monitor\nIt looks nice, I never played the original version but visually it looks very nice (usually)\nOkay, onto negatives:\nThe camera is\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in combat it zooms in on you when you attack someone but zooms in SO much that you can't see anything happening around you, and since the enemy AI usually goes after whover you are using, it means you are just asking to be flanked, and yes I know you can switch the camera to zoom out but who even thought zooming in was a good idea in the first place?\nUsing characters during combat is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing mess, it does this awful semi lock on feature that allows you to hit what you are aiming at, sounds good, right? Well it would be if your character didn't stop the moment you hit a button to attack, what I mean is their animation is static, so say you are attacking someone and they decide to run after someone else, well you are just stuck there looking like an idiot as your animation plays at as you attack the air, and since there is INPUT LOGS (meaning the game remembers what you pressed even during an animation so it plays after the current one is done) you could be attacking air for another 2 or 3 animations leaving you completely exposed, now you could argue that is down to not mashing a button and I agree but when I'm fighting an enemy I expect them to fight ME and not just have ADHD and go somewhere else.\nThis game is not friendly to any sword character, there are a ton of flying enemies that you can only hit with a single upward attack which is halfway through your combo cycle, so all your melee units are useless in these situations unless they have symbology or an art that allows them to reach said flying enemies. You could always switch to someone who uses a bow but that's one useful unit vs 3 other worthless ones.\nRemember when I said that the game looked good? It does from afar, when you get really close to the character models, you start to see some very obvious seam lines in the character's faces depending on who you are looking at, I don't know if it was this way in the original or it's just the HD textures but they all look so doll like that it is impossible to not notice.\nTLDR; Good port for those with 60Hz monitors but the game's combat mechanics are so bad that it makes it a chore to play.

{"product_id": "734580", "page": 10, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-26", "text": "There are quite a bit of people playing this game. It's kind of like when you put H1Z1 and a Team Deathmatch mode together.\nThe main mode you will probably be playing the most is where you have to destroy the enemys base. You can also loot buildings for loot like weapons, gas for your vehicles which you can craft with other items you find and food. The inventory works fine except i wish you could drag things around and equipt guns while you were looting a bag or something. You see when you loot a tent and find a gun you can only click on it once to move it to your inventory and then you have to exit the tents loot menu and then go back into your inventory to then click it again to replace it with your currently equipt weapon.\nThe games map looks quite good although i think the map is a bit too big for the ammount of people playing at this stage. When the game grows in popularity and there is hundreds of people on one server the map would be great, but right now with only 20 people some lobbies it's kind of boring walking all the way over to the enemys base just to shoot a couple people and then die and restart the whole process of walking down to their base. When there is lots of people playing I can see walking over to the middle of the map and having to push through all the enemys. That would work great with the map. It does look great though.\nThe vehicles. There are quite a few and you can counter them with bazookas or just your plain rifle. I would like to see more weapons and attatchments, right now it's kind of hard to aim at the other players that are far away from you with the default iron sight. Maybe for now just add crafting for 2x scopes or something because of how far the enemys are when you are shooting at them.\nNow. The soldiers. At first you play as a nazi so I'm guessing this game is based around WW2. The characters are quite small in game I would say increase the height and they do look pixelated. Weird considering that everything else in the game looks pretty fine. I would say that the characters bodies need some fixing up althought that might not be a priority at the moment.\nI think it would be nice if there were certain places you had to be to craft things like vehicles, because at the moment all you need is some crap and fuel to craft one. Maybe you should need something more to craft something of this scale maybe a mechanic shop.\nThere are different roles you can have on the team when you join, but you have to be certain levels to use the different soldies and right now the different roles only have different weapons and an extra thing that you would start off with. Maybe keep that the same but change the item that they start off with to work more with the role they have chosen to take.\nThis game shows great potential and I can see it being popular on steam sometime in the future if things like what I have mentioned are fixed and maybe change the UI? I'm not a big fan of the in-game UI it looks wird. I dont know maybe some people like it. I would maybe change the positioning of some of the things and make them easily viewable. Maybe put the map in the bottom right corner and have the ammunition above the health in the other corner. The place you can see what guns you are holding is pretty good. Maybe change some of the graphics on some things, not a big fan of how the map looks.\nYou can build thigns aswell like walls and chests although there is only one type of wall you cna place down and only one chest you can craft it is a thing that should be looked into. Its a cool idea being able to craft you own cover, but it needs to be executed just right, lots of games try this and do it wrong. There is also sniper towers you can build, you do need to rank up first... not sure this is a good system, they are essentially giving the experienced players an even bigger advantage to them already having played the game way longer than the newer players. I dont things that the things you can craft should be behind a level that you are forced to rank up to. If you are able to find the parts necessary to build the vehicle or sniper tower you should be able to. Giving the experienced players better things to work with is not a good way of implementing a new system like this.\nIn conclusion I think some things need to be tweaked and then we'll be having a ball.\n7 PIXELS OUT OF 11 PIXELS.", "hours": 0.4, "username": "sbondog", "products": 314, "early_access": true}

For some reasons it doesn't make me take screenshots but you can see the images in the game store page.\nBasically, the whole 1\u20ac game consists of a blue snake on a green field, chasing red pomegranates and sometimes white flowers (or biscuits or Idk what, the graphics are so Commodore-64 that I can't distinguish anything).\nThe only thing I can say is that, if the snake is simply a palette swap of the green field turned blue, those aren't apples but pomegranates.\nThis is an occasion for adding something interesting in this review - one of my favourite singers, Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1, debuted in 2011 with an awesome album entitled Anar and entirely drawn by an Iranian-American female illustrator called Nahid Hagigat. Anar (\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0631 ) means actually \"pomegranate\" in Persian and the cover art depicts a hand-drawn pomegranate. Yeah, the album is some really awesome pop and the pomegranates in this game are exactly the same as that cover art.\nOk, really, there's nothing else to say about this game.\nProbably Snake is one of those games which have no copyright, since we used to play it really for months on our Nokia phones at the high school ('cos back in the days when I was a teenager well cell phones simply didn't exist xD).\nThis one is simply a red and green colored version of Snake.\nYou can not do anything.\nNo remapping of the keys (only directional keys work), no options, no music, no levels. It's the Snake you all played on your phones fifteen years ago, probably not copyrighted and so completely plagiarized and copied without a single difference (apart from the pomegranates that aren't clearly apples).\nAnyways, as a liberal conservative guy, I admire the developers. They added 3000 achievements and managed to smuggle somehow an already-made game, sell it for 1\u20ac (ok, 0,10\u20ac on discount, not that high if you take into account how much life costs here in the richest regions of Europe..) and make profits every day.\nBy the way, achievements pop randomly.

I was a bit surprised when the opening cinematic was not only proper English, but voice acted with proper English as well.\nGameplay is fairly simple: select which turrets go on your ship (reminds me of gratuitous space battles), and pilot your ship around as your turrets auto-fire on enemies.  As enemies die, they drop crystals which can be spent on match specific upgrades.  The end of each battle features a boss to be defeated within a certain time limit.  There are 6 weapons to choose from, with two separate types (physical and optic).  At the end of each match, you are awarded with crystals to be spend on ship/turret/skill upgrades.\nA story does exist in this game (something about crystals and super powers), but it feels a bit forced and unnecessary.  The main character is an attractive anime chick, so I guess that is a plus.\nAnyways; the game is fun, the port works well, and the game kept me engaged.\nFeels a bit steep at ~$5, but I've paid more for less.  I'd recommend.\nOh. And as a bonus, I did not see any microtransation or pay to win shenanigans going on.", "hours": 1.8, "username": "KyleKidd", "products": 181, "early_access": false}

I had an issue with a mystery driver causing a BSOD (was driver's fault, not a problem with Driver Fusion Premium). They responded & gave pretty good support. I was able to install batches of a few drivers at a time until I found the culprit. Once I identified it, I just rolled back. If I understand correctly, a feature recently added should make it so that drivers can be installed one at a time without rescanning the whole system, saving even more time. I appreciate them leaving a note to let me know about the recent improvement (on Thanksgiving day, no less.)\nSome reasons to buy:\nIf you find yourself being the \"tech guy\" for friends and family who don't know what drivers are, let alone intall current drivers.\nIf you have a small fleet of computers to maintain (Gaming tower, HTPC, Work/school Laptops)\nIf you have an obsession/need for weird add-in cards (pcie wi-fi, sound, ethernet, etc. Possibly capture cards though I haven't tried those personally)\nIf you've ever been nailed with a shoddy/half-baked driver release tanking your system. (Driver rollback support is great. That's how I was able to diagnose and fix the issue I described at the beginning.)\nIf any of your hardware has dodgy or out-of-date support, or you find yourself on shady 3rd-party websites downloading a driver and hoping it's not really a trojan/malware.\nIf you are building a new rig, or build/upgrade often.\nPersonally, Driver Fusion has helped me out in all of the above scenarios. I will tell you right now anything this software does, you could do yourself for free. However, the time and pain saved running DFP has been well worth the asking price for me. I'm getting ready to build a new rig for 2018, and I'll be looking forward to a quick \"one & done\" driver solution for the build.\nIf you have the money and occasionally experience a few of the same scenarios as I did, or you're building a new PC soon, I'd say absolutely worth it on sale. If you have all of the same scenarios as I did or build often, I'd say even full price would be worth it.", "hours": 5.1, "username": "Nameless Bryan", "products": 761, "early_access": false}

This game is like the animus training ground in Assassins creed or Mirror's Edge.  Except you're doing the parkour in VR. It is so much fun and a good workout.  I'm just happy that it only requires the movement of my hands and not my feet.  Well, I wouldn't mind a head bobbing option in a future update (that makes you jog IRL).\nOnce you get past the first levels, the intensity and fun increases.  At level two, you start having to climb obstacles and start hand grinding on the walls (skateboard style, defying gravity), you'll feel like a workout super action hero.  Consider this your Ultimate Ninja starting grounds.\nI can't believe the polish and quality of the level design.  And you get a good workout.  Just needs feet tracking or head bob option for locomotion to really be a full body workout.  Anyways, my arms are tired.  Tapped out at 25 minutes.\nRating 8/10 would bump up to 9 out of 10 if headbobbing (or feet tracking is via Vive trackers or Kinect) is added", "hours": 0.4, "username": "FastLawyer", "products": 1215, "early_access": false}

Well, no since by \u201cnow\u201d, you could debate that the first flight of an object heavier than air and still capable of lifting a human being, either occurred during Antiquity in Asia (giant kites) or 18th century France (the Montgolfi\u00e8re hot air balloon). For all his brilliance, Leonardo\u2019s 15th century aerial screw \u201chelicopter\u201d was never a feasible design. Back to our game for now. It\u2019s a casual 2D title which has entertained me enough to overlook its flaws. The second Steam project for developer Epic Fire and the publishing debut for DNB Media.\nI can\u2019t really say much for the story since not even a title screen is present, once you boot up the game. From what I could notice however, the \u201cprotagonist\u201d can be regarded as a collective character in the form of a space ship which surely needs a crew in order to be maneuvered the way it is. Initially a red rocket which can be switched into a blue one, after 100 planets have been reached. The antagonists are also the obstacles between failure and success in Now Man Flies. Both homing missiles and static satellites will get in the way or even hinder your space exploration efforts.\nEven if it might be another Unity-powered title, Now Man Flies fails to mention this and the biggest sin it has commited in my opinion, is the limited Steam Overlay support that it features. Sure, the frame rate counter is present and unsurpringly, it never drops below 60fps even on my native 4K resolution. At least it has Vsync enabled and thus, spares me of having to play at a thousand frames per second. Yes, the graphics aren\u2019t much to look at yet it didn\u2019t bother me one bit. Casual genre is never synonymous with \u201ceye candy\u201d. It\u2019s priced accordingly afterall. Well, in most cases anyway. Now Man Flies won\u2019t allow me to take any screenshots of it through the Overlay and I really can\u2019t understand why some Steam titles still obstruct an innocent feature that can promote the game in question.\nThe soundtrack is comprised of just two songs which reminded me of mall elevators. Not repetitive enough to become annoying yet still nothing special. To make matters worse, one song gets unlocked after you pass the aforementioned planet threshold. No voice acting or sound effects are present.\nWithout any story to begin with, you\u2019d be right in the assessment of the gameplay. It has to compensate the lack of a narrative and in the case of most casual games, that is not an issue. Now Man Flies is not an exception from the rule per se, yet it does become rather repetitive within half an hour, provided you can tolerate its gameplay mechanics for that long. No change of scenery, foes and even controllable ship until you\u2019ve discovered a set number of planets. You might say that the incentive to keep playing is exactly the promise of that new song, ship skin and increased challenge through the unlockable Survival Mode. Reaching it, is only part of the challenge. Now Man Flies has an open-ended structure which means that you can keep on playing for as much as you\u2019d like. And you\u2019ll have to play A LOT until you finally unlock the Steam Achievement for over 32 hours of playtime. To put things into perspective, I\u2019ve seen all that this game has to offer, without even reaching 2 hours of playtime. Good luck dodging the same looking obstacles for another 30!\nYou\u2019ll have to endure and even grind through the Classic Mode which has the red rocket travel from planet to planet, all the way to the 100th discovery before the blue vessel takes over. While not a planet for certain, the encounter which makes this transition and marks the culmination of the \u201ccampaign\u201d, is a location that resembles the Death Star from Star Wars. What I couldn\u2019t explain was how can so many satellites interfere with space exploration, especially since we\u2019re being led to believe that we\u2019re breaking new grounds with each subsequent discovery. Also, why and who would try to stop these space pioneers through the use of so many guided missiles? If the answer you\u2019re imagining is \u201caliens\u201d, no other ships or structures are ever encountered. Just the red/blue rocket you\u2019re steering and the far-too-similar-looking blue satellites along with grey projectiles that seem to follow players at an obviously greater velocity than their target.\nMonotony is never setting in, simply because you have to become creative, by the time you\u2019ve passed your 50th discovered planet. Beyond the sheer number of obstacles, the randomly generated levels ensure that even if you fail a certain stage repeatedly, you\u2019ll still have to ambition yourself to overcome your mistakes, without having to replay in the same conditions over and over again. Also, the booster mechanic helps plow through foes and reach your destination sooner It can be used as a \u201cI win\u201d button on lower levels. By the time I reached stage 100 though, the booster was only a minor assistance, as instantly covering 10 thousand out of 30 thousand kilometres (only the Metric system is featured in-game) still gave me 20 thousand \u201creasons\u201d to remain focused on the digital onslaught ahead. Indeed, it was challenging and for this reason alone, I reconsidered my initial intention of slamming this game through a much lower rating.\nIt\u2019s not going to impress you and it certainly won\u2019t keep you as entertained as an excellent RPG or RTS, yet casual games have their very own niche on PCs. We\u2019re not talking of the lazy cash grabs that are prevalent to smartphone \u201cgaming\u201d. Steam needs to host casuals and fortunately, even Now Man Flies is priced within good measure and reason, in perfect balance with its offerings. You get what you pay for, yet it\u2019s still up to you to appreciate the game\u2019s fun factor. Just don\u2019t judge it for its first few levels. If you\u2019re an Achievement collector, it goes without saying that you\u2019ll enjoy this game thoroughly. At the time of this writing, there are five thousand Steam Achievements, waiting to be unlocked within Now Man Flies. With my limited playtime or not, I still managed to gain over three thousand. A considerable number, perhaps even crazy, since I haven\u2019t collected that many in all the Steam games I played in the past combined.\n+ Steam Achievements.\n+ Adequate scaling of the difficulty factor.\n+ Decently priced title offering exactly what it advertises.\n- No Steam Trading Cards nor Overlay screenshot support.\n- Inherently repetitive gameplay.\n- Limited sound selection.", "hours": 1.4, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "UN0W3N", "products": 5143, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Oh, be prepared to fix the resolution issue for about 2-3 hours that I think they purposely left so you won't be able to refund after fixing it. Go for KALDAREN'S FIX (forgot the name)\n**Do note this is in my own opinion and experience, but still I beg you to BUY THIS GAME and share my suffering. This game is by far the one disappointment for me and because of that I'll think twice before purchasing future square enix games from now on as this game feels like a Chinese Bootleg of \"Tales of Franchise\"**\nThis game is a Remaster of a previous star ocean, and yes SQUARE ENIX. So, take on the adventures of:\nA Pasty White Dude that has a hair where all the budget went to and gets stronger by with the power of friendship and love.\nA generic anime tsundere girl that acts all irritatingly cute every time and gets her\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665camera focused every battle after winning.\nA green gay elf boi that dances in the battlefield.\nAnother generic child girl that also acts irritatingly cute and dramatic who is overpowered.\nA middle-aged megaman whose rockets miss  90% of the time because it hits the ground and the wall behind him.\nAn Emo elf boi that wields a scythe. (well yea coz he's emo it's a requirement)\nOH MY GAD Another generic elf that is over-sexualized and every battle win focuses on you know where. Her Feet, where else?\nAn Angel.. i'm soo done.\nA Cat.. jfc, really? a cat... (She's a trap,btw)\nOkay so, be prepared to face the walking simulator of MMORPG sized maps with little enemies and treasures to be found as you'll be walking, dashing and walking for 2 hours because save points are that far apart in search of a cute for a disease that turns you into stone then after that into a raging generic lizard boi. (yes... it turns you to stone first and after that into a gecko, really square enix?)\nAs you delve into the immerse over-dramatic, repetitive acting and dialogue that takes 30minutes of poker-faced characters talk about how they wish they could've helped that guy, how they could've done better again and again then you'll skip it to go into another cutscene that just does the same routine in a different room AGAIN AND AGAIN so you skip it and they do it again on the first room! So you skip it and now you don't know where to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing go, so you google it and find out you're just gonna go to a town somewhere or a planet and talk about the same sh*t again then you mash the action button because that's all you're really gonna do... mash it for 60 hours and you'll finish the game.\nYou know what I'll just say the pros and cons to get it over with:\nPros:\nSays 13 hours steam in-game hours but my save time hours is already at 40+ hours haven't found any pros yet. Oh wait, I guess it has good graphics and apparently that's where all the budget went and Reimi's\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.. it is a remaster after all.\nCons:\nSave points are very far apart, be sure to have at least 1-2 hours to play the game.\nBonus Boards aren't carried over if you die and/or load you lose it all.\nMMORPG sized maps that will have you walking most of the time.\nCamera isn't properly adjusted to your actions, so if you were to walk into a small corridor/pathway. Well.. goodluck.\nUnnecessary and over-dramatic animations of opening doors and/or going into a different room\nCutscenes that take forever just to talk about the same thing over and over for about 3 or more cutscenes again.\nJuggling (air and ground) Mechanism. Apparently only applies to the enemy side they can juggle you forever but you can't do the same to them, after successfully juggling up to 3 hits they become invincible for some time but doesn't aply to you. So if it's you alone vs 4 enemies once one of them hits you and you stagger don't expect to be able to move. But if it's 4 of you against 1 enemy left you'll spend minutes chasing him down because that enemy won't do anything other than run around and you're unable to stagger him due to that mechanism.\nTargeting System. You can only target what is closest to you, even if you change target pressing start button it will return to the closest after a few seconds so hitting what you want is messed up and you end up getting the aggro of every enemy instead.\nAggro/Threat Ration. Okay so this is both a con and an exploit. Apparently Aggro only applies to the character you use regardless of their damage. Use your weakest character to hit a boss even if dmg is 0 until the boss aims for you after that run around the battle area while you fiddle with your phone and let your ranged unit that does 1k normal dmg and 3k on a crit hit the boss' back(which is most boss' weak point) because f*ck that character that hurts you right and before you know it. You win.\nResolution Issue. Game started being in a 4K resolution and you can't minimize it because you're unable to see it in your computer screen so you end up wasting 2 hours just to look for a fix and before you know it you can't refund it anymore. YEY!\nEDIT:\nPros:\nYeap. still nothing.\nCons I forgot to add before\nSkills Set\na. WHY DID YOU GIVE A HEALING AND SUPPORT MAGIC THAT COST A LOT OF MANA TO THE ONE CHAR WITH LOW INT AND MP?!\nb. WHY DID YOU GIVE TAUNT SKILL TO YOUR HITTER WHO HAS LOW HP AND DEF?! FOR WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?!\nTerrain and other obstacles.\nA small stone blocks you while a medium sized boulder is something you can pass thru. just wow.\nA plant that allows you to pass thru while another plan that looks exactly the same sometimes is considered as an obstacle.\nQuests. Do you remember those irritating fetch quests from MMORPG games? Yea? Well you'll do it with this game from start until new game+. Only difference is in this game it'll be planet to planet distance and would take a minimum of 30minute walk or more... yea i'm sure it's more than that.\nDifficulty. Heck doesn't matter what difficulty just spam X and you'll win even boss battles. OR do what I do due to the weak targeting and aggro system the game has.\na. Use the pasty white boi to get the aggo then let the boss focus you and make sure the wall is behind you so your archer \"DOES 3k dmg\" from the back and being ignored.\nb. Or use the overpowered midget that does 0 ranged dmg and run around while you have 3 ranged unit that 'DOES 3k dmg EACH\" from the back while being ignored.\nAmbush System. You need to let mobs chase you so you can chain them up for bonus exp and bonus board which is very difficult because they'll chase you for just barely 2 seconds then after ignore you for more than 5 seconds while going back or opposite of where that mob chased you.\nSkills. or more precisely \"lack of it\" to be more precise. At level 20 you only get 2 usable skill.\nCombos. Upon trial and error. There is no combo to this game other than spam action and your skill which is LT/RT(3x). The only variety of hits you get is:\nAttack Variety for short distance.\nAttack Variety for  long distance.\nAttack Variety for an arial enemy.\nThat's about it. Tilting the analog in any direction doesn't matter.\nBlindsides or Dodge. Is the only unique sh*t this game has which only works for regular enemies. Won't work on bosses coz they all have AoE and you'll get hit either way furthermore, Old Megaman Dude flies to the heavens above when he blindsides but still gets hit either.

The notion of a Shark invading the land is great. You essentially just rove around wreaking havoc and eating the town.

I got tired of it in around 10-15minutes of exploration. But I think it has potential to be a pretty fun game full of little mini games, upgrades, and possibly new unlockable environments.\nI would say the biggest barrier to entry currently is the conrols. They seem more akin to something you'd see in a dog fighting sim, rather than a game about flopping around as a shark and eating people. I would say that could use some simplification.\nOtherwise I found this reasonably fun. Would recommend it. Though again theres not a ton to do in the game yet.

Good game, all the basics are pretty squared away and it's got the makings of a really good game. The dev just needs to sharpen up the controls (mostly the camera really), clean up a few glitches (falling through the map), and add some missions/objectives.

The character models are nice and their eyes are very expressive, which I really enjoyed.\nI had no issues with the port apart for some minor lag when opening doors during a particular dungeon and the start of a fight. The lag was quickly resolved and did not cause further issues during my play time.\nThe fighting system needs some adjustment. I would recommend trying other characters and not sticking to Edge. I feel there's probably a better character out there to play as.\nWARNING, These bosses don't mess around, you better be ready!\nAlso friendly reminder, there's no menu save and save spots are far apart. So Save when ever you get the chance.\nOverall... I would say it made for a very enjoyable experience. Personally, I feel this is definitely a game to pick up and try out.

The game does not have a resolution 3440x1440 so I Can't even run it at full screen, do you have any idea how annoying that is playing on such a big monitor with 2560x1080 resolution.\nThe story is ok, I can't stand the main character in the game he seems like a whiny punk ***** if you know what I mean, hopefully it's just this short phase after a certain event but god, it's awful. I played in English up to this point but i've since switched to Japanese voices and it's a much better experience for me personally as I am an avid Anime watcher, this makes it bearable to deal with the terrible voice acting *english voice actors*\nThe price for the game is pretty nice, I know i've gotten my monies worth from the entertainment but I don't see myself going to 100% the game if thats an option let alone replaying it on a harder difficulty.\nIf they issue a 3440x1440 resolution I'd be much happier though.", "hours": 19.9, "username": "sLpFhaWK", "products": 160, "early_access": false}

Never owned a PS3 so I finally got a chance to play this!\nIt's a fantastically remastered game in terms of graphics, although some of the animations seem a tad unnatural and twitchy, it's very aesthetically pleasing to look at. That combined with combat mechanics (that I haven't quite mastered) from the previous installments that fans loved makes this game a very nice treat.\nIt's not perfect, however. Let's start with that camera, I find it extremely awkward to switch my right hand from my keyboard and my mouse constantly, which is a must due to the way the camera is aranged (using the arrow keys for camera adjustment and ENTER and BACKSPACE to interact with your surroundings, and attack/jump in battles). I digress, after making the mental adjustment and training yourself to switch your right hand to the mouse for battles, the game is a lot easier to play.\nOverall, the 2.5 hours of current gameplay lead me to conclude that this game is a definite steal for $19 and is worth a chunk of your precious time.", "hours": 5.0, "user_id": "76561198202533320", "username": "Jougi_Yoshi", "products": 2, "early_access": false}

But there is lots for me to dislike about this game in the fanchise.\nEveryone's faces just look creepy when playing this remastered version.  This game was just not meant for 4K.  Luckily I couldn\u2019t see their creepy eyes when playing the muddied low res PS3 version.\nThe animations and camera outside of combat are nausea inducing which makes exploring an absolute a pain. Even with depth of field and motion blur turned off their was no way for me to change camera speed or the terrible camera \u201cfloatiness\u201d to alleviate this issue.  The camera will keep moving for a good second after you let go. Also character movement is unresponsive in and out of combat since it takes them time to begin their walking animation.\nI don\u2019t really know what else this game has to offer because I only played a decent 5 or so hours on the ps3. Why I bought this game? Who \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing knows.

The graphics were remastered.\n2. Myuria and her right bouncing tiddy.\n3. Myuria and her left bouncing tiddy. (Her left tiddy is covered up a bit because of the shawl she wears. Therefore, her other tiddy gets a higher ranking from me.)\n4. A fluid combat system that is easy to learn but deep enough to satisfy those who like the tough difficulty settings.\n5. Myuria and her mini skirt. (Gotta love the occasionally lecherous camera angle when Myuria gets to do the battle pose.\n)\n6. Item invention is less annoying in this Star Ocean than it was in Till the End of Time, but that's not saying much.\n7. The game is resonably priced for what it is.\n1. DO NOT Alt-Tab in this game. Just don't do it.\n2. There can be hours between save points.\n3. The \"bonus board\" must be one of the most frustrating inventions in game design history. If you like to play as a melee character, the \"bonus board\" will have you using all the profanity you know...loudly and often.\n4. The game has many moments where you can't backtrack to other places you have been before due to the story.\n5. I guess the game does have a story, but the cutscenes are mostly meaningless. Some are cringe-worthy.\n6. The cast of characters leaves much to be desired. I couldn't get into the characters back in the PS3 days, and I can't today.\n7. The English voice acting was particularly sterile in this Star Ocean. If that sort of thing bothers you, at least you do have Japanese voice and English subtitles.\n8. Oh great anime god in Nippon, please save us from Welch! >.<\n9. Where is my post-game save file? No, seriously, where did it go? As it turns out, I don't care enough about the game for me to play the game after Edge & Co. save the pangalactic community, but it's still annoying that my post-game save file disappeared.\n1. The game has grinding points built into the game, but it doesn't bother explaining where those are. If you guess wrong on the grinding points, you may end up loading a save file many hours of gameplay backwards.\n2. Some of the grinding points will have you spending a ridiculous amount of time at those points because the astute gamer figures out that better rewards per hour of play can be attained only at those certain places in the game.\n3. The game intends on the gamer playing until level 250 to fill up their skill masteries, and it is up to the gamer to figure out what to do with the seemingly epic mismatch between skills to master and available skill points. And since a character respec option does not exist, the astute gamer's best option remains to amass a large quantity of skill points, save the game, then try investing in one skill. Then reload the game, invest in a different skill, try it out on some enemies, and so on.\n4. When can and when should the gamer go back to the previously-visited planets to open up the elemental-magic-locked chests? This game secret is completely unnecessary and adds nothing but frustration to the game.\nIf you are still reading this review and you have not yet played the game but you will do so soon, take my advice and use all 20 save files.

I found alchemy Defender VR to be pretty mediocre.\nThe Tower Defense mechanics are decent. Placing towers was slightly troublesome when placing near edges as the button press/release when placing the tower caused the placement to jerk. Rushed tower placements either meant a very sub optimal placement or failing to place the tower entirely.\nThere did not seem to be any sort of creep to tower relationships. IE mortar counters slow groups, Ice counters runners etc... There were simply 3 towers. A low damage, a utility and a high damage.\nThere was no upgrade system for towers. How do you make a TD game without the ability to upgrade your towers? That's half of the game...\nI would have liked to see more variety in towers and enemies. The TD aspect really needed to be fleshed out.\nThe first person combat aspect was just bad. Enemies died at the slightest touch of the melee weapon. I could stand still and enemies would walk into the weapon and die. This is just unacceptable in any VR hack and slash. It's bad. Stop doing it devs.\nThere is only one form of locomotion and it didn't work all that great. The only locomotion option is teleportation. Even so, I often found myself stuck in a location I could not teleport out of unless it was a considerable distance away. I can normally use either teleport or trackpad but I love having the option. This just felt clunky.\nBalance was also an issue. Early game my towers were often not enough making me scramble to use all my combat abilities. Late game my towers were enough to handle everything and I rarely needed to go into combat mode. There needs to be a better balance here.\nAs I started with, Alchemy Defender VR was simply mediocre. Their attention was split between the two game modes and ultimately not enough love/polish made it into either side. It has some good ideas but ultimately the execution falls flat.

In Alchemist Defender VR, you assemble your defenses whilst overlooking a village environment from above and can then change your perspective simply clicking to jump down into the environment if you wish, to engage in direct first person combat (a feature that is similar to Out of Ammo). Throughout the game you defend a door using the handheld weapons which include a hammer, pistol and bomb, and and also three available tower weapons known as Canon, Frozt and Mortar. The latter can be purchased as you can afford based on your gold count which you can increase, and placing them strategically on turrets, continuing in this manner through oncoming waves of enemies for as long as you can survive. There are a variety of enemies, and the game gets harder as you progress with more and more oncoming enemies with each wave. The graphics are great, the environment is beautiful and super detailed as is the animation. However, the gameplay is limited at this stage, and so it can become quite repetitive. Although you would expect some repetition because it is a tower defense game, there isn\u2019t enough content at the moment to justify the price point, and so I feel it is good as a simple tower defence game but overpriced for what it actually has to offer at this stage in terms of gameplay. I think this game has a lot of potential though and could live up to the price point in the future if it is developed further, so I am looking forward to playing it again in it's prime. Suggestions include more weapons, upgrades, a changing or additional environment, more enemies, and enemies with different levels of difficulty or a more strategic way of doing battle with certain enemies. However, I have been informed since my video review that there is already plans for updates such as these, and some may have now even been added since my pre-release beta review video.", "hours": 2.0, "username": "JadeKVR", "products": 449, "early_access": true}

What I really like about Alchemist Defender is that you can build your strategy in god mode and watch your cannons do its work or help them by using certain weapons to combat the monsters in first person mode. This game can get quite hard to complete after a couple of waves and you'll definitely need to pay attention or have a good strategy to complete the first level.\nThere are some nice to haves, like I think that a more challenging first person combat mode would be nice.\nI'd recommend this game if you like tower defense games in general. It's fun and a nice change to play in VR. However I do think it's expensive for what's available now in early access.

Jumping into a first-person view and battle the enemies is just awesome! Check my pre-release gameplay video and you will understand what I mean:\nHere are my thoughts:\nWell, Alchemist Defender VR really surprised me. I have never been a big fan of tower defence games so far to be honest, but if you do all stuff right in a Virtual Reality game, its like a whole new genre! With immersive gameplay, beautiful graphics as well as environment, and also this first-person perspective you can jump into any moment during gameplay, Alchemist Defender does something totally new and unique!\nStarting off, the graphics (made in Unreal engine) are stunning. The sounds and background music are pleasing and perfect for this type of game. Main menu is cool with lots of stuff you can interact with, just like you expect from a VR-game. Well, so far I have nothing to complaing about, and I have played this title for more that an hour now.\nThe \"miniature world\" that you see from above is super vivid, colorful and detailed. You begin by building some towers, turrets and cannons before the waves of evil Rat-Humanoids arrive. The same second it starts, you realize this is going to be intense. So intense that your towers are not enough, so you grab your hammer or a pistor, teleport yourself into the world and start a battle on your own in first person view :) And it gets more and more busy for every wave, at the same time as the game gets even better!\nHonestly, the first moment you \"slide\" into the frist person perspective is one of the coolest VR experiences I have had so far. I really can\u00b4t describe it, its just super-immersive!\nAnyway, the gameplay is nice, the level of difficulty is increasing and after around 8-10 waves things become really serious. I think this game is a challenge even for the most skilled tower-defense gamer out there.\nWhile playing Alchemist Defender VR without capturing the gameplay (as I did in the video above), the game runs very well on my GTX 980 Ti and I could probably add some supersampling to get it even sharper, so even thou the graphics are stunning, you still dont need a beefy PC I guess.\nI will update this \"review\" as soon as I have played more and especially when more content gets added later on. But for now, I can truly recommend this VR game to everyone - try it and you won\u00b4t regret it!\nCheers\nMartin, SweViver", "hours": 1.1, "username": "SweViver", "products": 244, "early_access": true}

{"product_id": "734580", "page": 15, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-17", "text": "After giving another shot this game I have to say that I've may be a lil bit wrong, HOWEVER this game has A LOT of work to be good.\nFirst of all, maps... Well... Map...\nIt's just one and the same map, but big (way too big) with multiple villages. And it can easilly get boring. Maps should be smaller, but designed to easilly find front line and enough wide to flank.\nThis game for sure need more maps, for example city map (Stalingrad? Maybe something like that).\nSecond thing are Game Modes.\nWe have TDM (Team Deathmatch)- okey, it's fine, but players a lot of time don't focus on main objective and just rush to factory to craft a tank, which will be destroyed faster than they'll build it.\nAlso we have BAS (Base Assault) - okey, BUT there's one mayor problem, which is how far Factories are from base. Before players will gather resources to build one enemy will fix base (which is completly stupid in my personal opinion and makes this mode almost endless). Also this makes more players to focus on defend Factory then Base (and about Assault I'll not talk).\nFor this game Conquest mode (multiple capture points), Attack & Defence and King of the Hill (one capture point) will be best and enjoyable to play (and more avaliabe servers with or without crafting/vehicles).\nNext thing are glitches and bugs. Here's some I've been already noticed:\n- Hitbox (not every hit counts, not every 100+DMG shot kills)\n- \"Delete\" button, which completly broke interface, but turn into something like a slow spectate mode.\n- Compas, which is ultra broken and it's impossible to tell any location for friendly.\n- Map (M), also requires some tactical positions (for ex. A-10, F-5, etc.)\n- Alt+Tab sometimes work, another time will broke game (to be correct, it won't allow to come back)\n- Scope in Sniper Rifles feels funky. It's too easy (it should move a lil bit), yet not always accurate (not every direct hit in the cross will hit there) and it should have better zoom (well... It's a sniper, not DMR). This should also a lil bit rebalance this weapon, since a lot of players is saying that is OP.\n- Bazooka & Panzershreck are quite annoying. I know how they should be used, but moslty players just run with them, destroy all buildings or fight the players. I actually have no better idea than delete this class (or make it premium) and just let these weapons randomly spawn.\n- Double (or multiple) press F5 will broke interface.\n- Minimap needs an \"always visible\" objectives, so players won't be run around to find the front line.\nAnother thing are the game settings, which are really poor and don't even allow to set own bind keys. For example I'd love to play on higher settings, but that blure effects annoys me and makes everything much more less visible.\nAlso some players (and I) noticed that day/night time zones are not that great. Just hard to feel it really. And that sun's brightning, especially at morning and evening... Just blinds completly.\nAlso I've noticed at least two regular players that cheat in this game. Let's be honest, it's impossible to kill someone with a hammer from 220m while shoting an APC or Tank...\nAnother thing that is missing is Prone (laying on the ground). It actually would be good for this game.\nDynamite has (in my opinion) quite small AOE, so as bomb it's designed to blow the sht out (buildings, vehicles, tanks).\nSometimes I see that APC can penetrate walls and buildings like a paper, which is completly stupid compare to how single APC can destroy entire infrantry.\nAnd for last I hope for a better wood cutting, since it allows to create the most basic defences. It's not bad, but it may be better (more wood per hit, faster to cut down tree).\nI hope that's all I've been noticed so far and Devs will notice this. :) Game has a potential, but \"It's a long way to the top if you wanna Rock n' Roll\" (AC/DC). :V\n* Update! *\nAfter a while I'll say NO. Devs forced the game from Alpha to Beta, while it still works like an Alpha game. Still tons of things to do. Beside of small fixes they just add new things (to buy!) instead of truly fixing and upgrading the game. Literally still same bugs and glitches I see in every single match...", "hours": 61.3, "username": "WRG-West", "products": 16, "early_access": true}

I will be as fair as I feel I can in this review. I play with a full PC sim setup. Fanatec clubsport pedals and a clubsport 2.5 wheel base with the BMW wheel.  I also play Assetto Corsa with the same setup. PC2 feels much more realistic than PC. Car control is better and the graphics are better in their subtlety.  In short I generally run the same courses/cars faster in PC2 than in the original version.  While PC2 is an improvement overall, from my point of view it has some serious short comings. In no particular order:\n1) the AI is NUTS with penalties!!!!!  and it is inconsistent. Opponents do NOT get penalized for doing much worse things than I do.  If I loose control and go off I am penalized. Brush a guard rail..penalized. Cut an apex within what would be allowed at an scca sanctioned event...penalized.\n2) Qualifying. I can't for the life of me understand why with the competion factor set at 92% in PC I can consistently qualify in the top 3, more often than not, pole; yet in PC2 I can seldom qualify higher than 12th IF I can even get a qualifying time.  Yet, in the race with cars that were 2-4 seconds faster than me I am consistently able to finish in the top 5 and even occasionally win.\n3) During the race.  I love to race at Bathhurst. HOWEVER....there is a glitch in the game here. Again the best I have been able to qualify is 12th. I am often in the top 5 at the end of the first lap, sometimes the lead. I carry way more speed through the uphill than any one else and am faster everywhere else EXCEPT the back straight. I come on to that straight with a car lengths lead, stretch it to 3 by the over head banner, yet at the end of the straight I ALWAYS get passed or rear ended by the car that wasn\"t even close before. On the flip side of that coin, I can come on to that straight within a car length of the car in front of me and he will pull 3-10 car lengths on me at the end of the straight. This is in identical Mitsu evo's.\nIn general I like PC2 better than the original and my next purchase is an Oculus Rift the next time they are on sale. But PLEAAAASSSSSEEEEE... fix the glithches. At $90 for the top game pkg, we should see a steady stream of updates and fixes. Also as far as addons.. More real world cars. I drive the Evo because it is the only comparable car to my WRX STi. I am willing to bet there are WAY more WRX's on the road than EVO's.  It might be fun to hop in a Lambo or Ferrari but in real life I will never do that. So I want to hone my skills in something that I Might be able to afford.

Here are some of the highlights and, as always, you can see the full change log here: http://www.engine001.com/changes.htm\nIt took a while but we've finally added tooltips to all major windows and their respective sub-windows in 001! Our\nwill always have the most detailed explanations but these tooltips should provide users (particularly newcomers) with some much needed help in understanding what all of these options/controls actually do.\nThis crucial fix has resulted in improved smoothness in higher framerate games and has consequently improved the accuracy of Spawns/Timers!\nA new option inside the Game Settings window which allows game timing to be more predictable, resulting in more consistent gameplay regardless of game performance. Essentially, this tells your game that the FPS is always whatever you've set so if there's a hiccup, it'll run the game X number of times until it's caught up. This should help to resolve collision detection issues (Actors falling through floors, doors, walls, etc. when they're not supposed to)\nPLEASE NOTE: If your game already suffers from performance issues, then this setting may make things worse! It's also advised that the \"Minimum Framerate\" option is set to nothing lower than 30.\nBe sure to follow the official\naccount to see new posts every Monday, Thursday and Saturday showcasing the awesome games made in 001! Here's some of the things you've been missing:\nWe'd like to thank all of you for your continued support throughout the year and we hope you all have a happy holiday and new year! We'll be back in 2018 with even more cool updates for 001 Game Creator, so look forward to it! :)", "early_access": false}

The gameplay involves shooting bandits such as the notorious Dynamite gang, in your role as the crime fighting sheriff, whilst galloping on your stick horse around scenic landscapes. The game uses free locomotion, and you move using your horse with one hand, and your gun with the other hand to shoot the bandits. The use of the stick horse is a very unique and fun to experience way of implementing free locomotion, and works incredibly well for this game adding to the experience. The gameplay is otherwise typical of an FPS game, but enjoyable as there are several maps to explore, and the game could even be a little challenging at times as you juggle moving on your horse whilst using your weapon, as simultaneously you need to ensure your horses health is maintained by stopping to let it drink water which could be mid-shootout! The voice acting, sound effects and music are well done, and the game is also beautiful in terms of graphics.

Probably not a game I'll keep coming back to, though it is a good workout if you don't cheat.\nSo the way you move in this game is by pretending you are a 6 year old kid riding a broom while pretending it is a horse.  You do this by either doing the Monty Python Horse skip:\nor by hoping up and down in place.  The faster your skip/hop the faster your horse runs.\nWatching someone play this game is quite entertaining as they look ridiculous.  Playing the game also is ridiculous because in the game you are holding a stick with a stuffed horse head on the end of it, so you know exactly what you look like to those watching.\nThere is some risk of motion sickness here.  I found that when I stopped the horse, I instinctively leaned backwards and if I was going particularly fast it would sometimes almost cause me to fall over.  Also, when riding the horse down a slope it can be pretty jarring and I found myself again leaning backwards.\nI recommend only playing this if you have a bit of space.  It is _really_ easy to get immersed into the game and not realize that you are hopping off towards a wall.  The VR chaperone is still there of course, but if you are close to a wall and then stop your horse in the middle of a gun fight it is easy to lean backwards into the wall.", "hours": 0.3, "username": "Micah", "products": 285, "early_access": true}

You know what you're getting into at this point in time- this game is by no means new. You've heard everyone's takes on the plot, the dub, the character design, you name it. I don't think it's quite as bad as some say in those regards, but it's not tri-Ace's best work by a longshot. Gameplay's pretty fun though. I never did like how Edge felt on map though (out of battle), a little too twitchy for my taste.\nAll in all, this is a pretty solid port. If there's any way to play this game, it's this. A few nagging issues bother, but nothing major. The fullscreen/window handling is a bit dodgy- so alt-tab won't work great unless you get that Special-K patch for it.\nThere are GPU performance discrepancies on my GTX 670 at 1080p. Purgatorium's whirlpool animation is the most egregious so far, dropping my framerate for a bit of time to as low as 4 frames per second. I have confirmed this with multiple people on Discord that it is a problem area for them, too. However, outside of some slight framedrops on Sahariel's rocket explosions and a few loading hiccups, I haven't noticed much in the way of performance issues in the vast majority of scenarios.

This new update is mostly bug fixes but a few small additions have also been made, including the ability to specify an Android version code (to help facilitate APK updates on the Google Play store) and a new \"Comment\" event that can be placed inside scripts to let other developers know what your script is doing. We've also made 001 automatically launch Steam, if launching from an executable and Steam isn't running, thanks to user feedback!\nIn regards to bug fixes, there are a few we'd like to mention specifically. Mainly that the \"Overflow\" error some users were experiencing has now been resolved! We've also fixed some memory and GDI object leaks that were causing \"Out of Memory\" errors for certain computers, fixed level/experience from not being properly maintained in minimalistic saves and also fixed rounding issues with position of animations in sprite sequences (which resulted in certain movements not always being very smooth).\nAs always, you can see the full list of changes here: http://www.engine001.com/changes.htm\nLooking towards the future, I'm pleased to let you all know that we've begun the slow and arduous task of implementing tooltips for every major window inside 001 Game Creator. While the\nwill always provide the most detailed information about 001's features, we've nonetheless heard the outcry for built-in tooltips and have started doing exactly that! Once implemented, you'll be able to hover your cursor over any control in 001 to get a brief explanation of its functionality. This should help to clear up a lot of the confusion newcomers have with some of 001's more advanced features and we hope you look forward to seeing them!\nWe're planning to roll out the first batch very soon, which will include completed tooltips for the following main windows: Actor, Field, Sprites, Tile-Sets and Items/Magic.\nWhile on the subject of documentation, you'll also be pleased to hear that a brand new video tutorial series is currently in the works. After much deliberation, we've decided that the best approach would be to show a game being built from start to finish and showcase as much of 001's functionality along the way. We've already got someone on board who will be writing all of the tutorials and a framework is currently in the works that details what the series will end up covering. We hope to start rolling out video tutorials on a consistent basis once all of the details have been finalised.\nWant to see the amazing things people have created with 001 Game Creator? Then why not follow the official\naccount for new posts every Monday, Thursday and Saturday to see exactly that! Here are some of the things you've been missing:\nThank you all for your continued support of this project and to all of those who worked so hard on the creation of the\n.

Before I even begin my review, lets check out my first gameplay in VR and Mixed Reality on HTC Vive:\nWell, where to start? First of all, Hopalong: The Badlands is beautiful. Very beautiful! It really has that well-made and good looking graphics, cool environment and that funny wild-west stylish atmosphere. For a indie-title VR game, this is really impressive I have to say. The graphical surroundings reminds me a lot about Arizona Sunshine, well maybe almost at least and also a little bit more \"cartoonish\", but still very polished and detailed. I was truly surprised and impressed the first moment I entered the game.\nSound effects and voice-overs are great (reminds me of Arizona Sunshine again), and especially the western-style guitar music in the background that adds a lot to the feeling.\nGameplay then! Well, this is a funny cartoon/comedy-styled first person shooter with free locomotion, several weapons (both shooting and melee), several big maps to explore and various cowboy-opponents to kill. The gameplay itself is of course simple and maybe not unique for a VR shooter, but the one-of-a-kind locomotion itself adds so much to the game! You simply ride a stick-horse totally freely around the levels, by navigating with your left Vive controller, while you shoot and use weapons with the right controller (or vice versa or course).\nAnd thats where the fun part begins in Hopalong: The Badlands. The ability to run around on a stick-horse is on its own simply a brilliant idea and it adds so much \"more\" in Virtual Reality - you wont believe me before you try it. I couldn't stop laughing in the beginning, it was just so fun to ride/galloping on that stick horse, and at the same time does this game a little bit more challenging as well, as its much more difficult to aim and kill the enemies while galloping, even if aiming is accurate and weapon handling is good! Also, you gain health by letting your \"horse\" drink water, for example. Just brilliant idea - these developers has been thinking \"outside of the box\" and I love that, especially because most VR games are too similar to eachother!\nThe game runs great on my GTX 980 Ti, and only time I got frame loss (dropped frames) was while I was recording the gameplay at the same time, so thats not because of the game, but more because of my capture software taking too much resources.\nAll in all, a truly entertaining, beautiful and kind of unique Western-shooter, and I can recommend it to everyone. I really hope the devs will work hard on this title to bring us more content, and especially Multiplayer support further on - that would we awesome!\nI will eventually continue or update this review when I have spent more gameplay hours in the game, and especially when more content gets added in future updates!\nCheers\nSweViver", "hours": 0.8, "username": "SweViver", "products": 244, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

Fix this problem devs, tho it doesn't affect me but there might be players who can run this game on low settings only.\nWhat I think is the coolest feature is that you have to actually collect resources for tanks or any other craftable thing, you can't just spawn infinite tanks or cars etc., makes game more challenging that way.

{"page_order": 13, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-12", "text": "At first glance, this game seems to be shamelessly ripping off MtG.\nIt's not.\nSure, it has a very similar resource system, and it has the same mulligan system, and it has the same deck size. Unlike any MtG video game, though, Hex is able to exercise the freedoms that only digital CCGs can exercise. For example, buffs/debuffs on Troops stay around even once they're killed, which creates interesting possibilities for buff-themed decks. Tracking such buffs/debuffs in real life would be a nightmare, especially after you've buffed a whole slew of Troops. Another great example is the socketing system, which lets you add special effects to certain cards.\nBut the real reason this game is awesome is because it has a full PvE campaign. The devs have created so much variety that it has never felt stale. There's always some new twist; in one dungeon, there were these\nthat threatened to sweep away swaths of my deck. If I didn't kill them fast enough, part of my deck would be removed for the rest dungeon run. In another dungeon, there's this branching path and you have to choose between which of two bosses you want to slay. The boss you skip isn't content to just sit around, however; he comes back\n.\nFurthermore, the devs aren't afraid to challenge you. There are several encounters that are simply too strong for certain deck strategies. It's these times that I have to stop and look at my collection and see what I have which can counter the given enemy. There are many times I realize that I simply don't have the ability to handle the situation, though. It feels great coming back and thrashing these encounters once I do have the correct tools.\nI haven't even mentioned how much customization there is for campaign character(s). Not only is there a skill tree, there's also a bunch of equipment built specifically for PvE. I'll let you explore this for yourself, but I'll say that it works surprisingly well when combined with deck building.\nUnfortunately, the PvP scene is not easy to get into. Unlike most virtual CCGs, a lot of the better PvP cards are costly, usually only available for trade using the premium currency, Platinum. Unless you spend some cash, obtaining these cards requires a lot of grinding.\nBeyond regular constructed, there's also a sealed format. Similar to real-life sealed tournaments, you open card packs and use these packs to construct a deck. As you progress through the tournament, you get to open more packs, and these new cards can be added to your deck to improve it. The best part is that you keep all the cards you open this way, so it's a great way for a new player to get their PvP collection started. The only problem is that, in order to enter, you have to use a sizeable chunk of Platinum.\n(Funny story: I was only able to enter because a kind soul pitied me after thrashing me in constructed. Despite turning down their kind offer, they insisted on giving me the necessary Platinum to enter the Evo Sealed tournament. I don't think this happens too often.)\nOverall, the cost isn't too bad if you compare it to printed TCGs; you aren't getting physical cards, but, as I previously mentioned, you get to play a game optimized for the digital gameplay. It does seem harsh when compared to most modern online CCGs, however.\nThe deck-building feels clunky most of the time. (I shouldn't have to click 48 times to add all the resources to my deck!) Also, somebody forgot to create the \"New deck\" button when managing campaign decks, which means I need to click at least 120 times to totally empty my deck and start from scratch. The auction house interface is okay, but for some reason it prioritizes Platinum offers over Gold offers unless you apply the right filters. There are some card interactions that are ambiguous, and the only way to check what happens is to actually put a deck together and experiment. (Not to mention that some of the cards have so much text on them that there is a\nin their text box. As a game designer, this churns my stomach.)\nFortunately these are mostly interface flaws, and they shouldn't be too hard to patch. If you're reading this in the future, the devs may have fixed these issues.\nBut enough negativity. All in all, Hex's campaign is glorious, and I think even players who don't typically play card games will enjoy it. Playing Sealed has been a blast, and I'm excited to try PvP once I grow my collection big enough. I think this game is certainly worth playing, but be wary that it the game eats surprisingly large amounts of time even if you're just playing PvE.", "hours": 90.8, "username": "AutoFireII", "products": 79, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

A good alternative to real money is that if you really like the game and commit yourself to it you can with a very low money investment build some decent decks Be it by farming fopr gold and then buying cards for the free in game currency or if you're confident enough on your abilities try to cash in via the draft. i'm not a good drafter but I have some friends that where able to build some more than decent deck and get there hands on powerfull cards just by buying very few platinum (in game real currency) and rolling in the drafts.\nLike all TCG you have a variety of format for you to play, Draft, severals constructed rules formats. My only cons to this is maybe the lack of a more casual one because once you hit the PvP you can feel the competivity and challenge that come with the game.\nBut what this game has that Mtg doesn't is a very nice PvE environment that allows you to play for fun, for farming and some nice rewards, even some rewards that can be very usefull in PvP.\nThe developers also try to make all  they can to add events to made the game always going forward. You have of course the classic option of tournament where you can cash in real money, hollydays events with special PvE cards and new game formats like the incomming siege.\n+\nA very well done TCG\nA huge variety of formats for everyone to play\na challenging and  yet pleasant PvE\nThe possibility to play the game for almost for free be it with your skill in the drafts or by spending time farming gold.\nLots of differents cards and mechanics allowing for a wide variety of decks (even if in some case some decks or cards just steal the show and become a must play)\nThe champion mechanics that adds some variety on how you play your cards.\nLess expensive when you invest real money than most of the other TCG I came across specifically MtG\nA really active player community.\nActive developers when you come across a bug.\n-\nLike all the TCG some cards or deck  become must play if you want to success. Righ now if you didn't get your hands on the runebind (10$ real money) card you were missing the most important card and add a hard time competing at a high level.\nThe PvE that doesn't grow fast enough.\nLack of a more casual environment. When you start playing in the constructed format you can feel that most players aren't here for the fun. If you can't find friends to play it for fun it can be hard on beginners or casual players.\nConclusion :\nFor me a veteran Magic player, Hex is one of the best TcG I have come across.

(I felt like it was a little sappy)\nBesides that:\nThe story is pretty solid. It draws you in and makes you want to learn about the characters and the world they live in. It also gives you a look behind what happened prior to the very first game on SNES and the Second Story.\nCombat is fun, its definitely a more refined version of what you saw in the previous series. The boss battles are pretty hard but thats true for any Star Ocean game.\nYou get a wide range of party members each with different specialties and attacks.\nThe graphics are nice to look at. It wasn't full on \"cell shading\" anime style and honestly that was welcome. The cut scenese are very well done too. Fair warning: the cut scenes are very long.\nThis one actually ties into the rest of the series and there are head nods to the other games and its lore. I really liked that.\nI would reccomend this game for anyone who is a fan of the series and for people who enjoy a good JRPG once in awhile.\nThe price is more than fair and that was awesome that they did a discount for the launch; albeit a small one.", "hours": 54.2, "username": "stupidanimeface", "products": 427, "early_access": false}

Will you end up a proud owner of fine cosmetics like last week's Bash\nor Clash\nwinners?\n\u00a0\nJoin us this weekend and find out!\nFor full details on prizing, please check out our tournament pages here\nand here\n.\nPlease note: if you happen to have technical issues with the Clash or Bash events, our support team requests that you submit an output log from that same day along with your ticket. This is essential, not only to ensure your ticket gets resolved in a timely fashion, but also to help us prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. Output, error, and crash logs can be found in the HEX: Shards of Fate program install folder on your machine.\nBy now you've read today's lore article, right? No? Okay, give it a quick gander\nand then come back. It's alright, we'll wait.\nSo now that you know some of the major beats coming in\n, let's talk a bit about story. HEX's digital nature lets us do all sorts of pretty innovative things. Much of that you see everyday when you play with the cards themselves. Our R&D team puts a lot of love into crafting an incredibly rich and unique experience. But, part of the exciting innovations we can bring relate to story... and art. Because things are digital, as our story evolves, we are able to have key characters evolve too. Thus, we have a secret champion change to announce for our\nroster. Puck and Balthasar are no more. Instead, we now have Balthasar the Elegist:\nThe death of a dream is a truly painful thing.\nStay tuned here and on social media for more\nspoilers as we gear up towards release!\nSee you in the battlegrounds~\nGot any questions? Want to chat with other players? Then discuss this article in our Forums\n! You can also follow us on Twitter, Facebook, our YouTube channel, or enjoy regular streams on our official Twitch channel\n.", "early_access": false}

From a driving standpoint, most cars are fairly easy to handle. As such things like heel toe downshifting, rev matching, and car tuning are all fairly easy. Every car has a distinct feeling and every track feels and looks real.\nWhat about features???\nTime trials is by far my favorite mode. If you love racing others for world records on tracks this game logs it all. It's a great challenge to beat another person's time and you don't have to worry about actually \"racing\" other cars. Career mode is challenging at times if you want it to be. Adjusting the AI can make it even more of a challenge. Online racing is eh, not many lobbies exist and if there are it might not be a track or car you want to race with. Also the penalty system seems to be a bit broken, with you being heavily punished for cutting corners or making contact. If you are simply looking for online P2P racing, this is NOT your game. That corner of the market has been claimed by AC, rFactor, and iRacing.\nWhat about graphics???\nExcellent, simply excellent.\nAnd sound?\nGreat, as well.\nPhysics?\nOn most tracks the physics are fine, but sometimes cars will act wildly when they go airborne on certain tracks. This can be annoying.\nTracks and Cars???\nThere is such a wide variety of tracks and cars. All of the world's top tracks are included so your favorite track is most likely in the game. Fun road courses and rallycross tracks are also included. Dozens of cars are in the game, and if you are into GT racing, then this game has your favorite car most likely. The vintage cars are a unique challenge as well.\nVerdict-9/10\nUnless you are a super hardcore sim racer or a only-race-online type, this game will probably be your favorite racing game out there. In my eyes it is only rivaled by Dirt Rally which is in a different class of racing anyways.", "hours": 20.9, "user_id": "76561198049575798", "username": "Maverick018", "products": 96, "early_access": false}

There is very little out there that he hasn't had his hands in at one point in time. He made some of the first HEX videos around, streams constantly, and has many podcast appearances to his name. He even made his way to our first ever HEX Invitational. All that would be impressive on its own, but this person was also instrumental in bringing to life our yearly charity stream tradition. This charity stream has been a rallying point for the community, and with his (and your) help, we as a community continue to raise truly impressive amounts of money to help sick kids. It is for this reason that we are happy to announce that InfamousNeo is this year's Community Exalted:\nYou've inspired us to be greater than the sum of our parts. You continue to bring us together, both on and off stream, which is why we are pleased to grant a vanity card in your honor. Thank you so much for everything you have done for HEX and the people who play it.\nSee you in the battlegrounds~\nGot any questions? Want to chat with other players?

They have been a tireless proponent of the game from the moment they joined and have continually striven to help others play at a competitive level. This player writes extensively, whether it is articles covering the latest constructed tech or programs for displaying decklists just a little bit easier, and they have even compiled resources for players looking to break into the constructed scene. As if that weren't enough, they also find time to stream regularly to showcase exciting new decks and help move the meta forward.

A new version of 001 Game Creator (v1.018.008) is now available on Steam and is packed with tons of new content and bug fixes.\nAs always, you can see the full change log\nNow let's go over some of these changes, shall we?\nWhat better place to start than with the first thing you're greeted with upon opening 001 Game Creator. In an effort to make 001 a little more user-friendly, we've tweaked the New / Open Game window to be more streamlined:\nAdditionally, we've cleaned up the main toolbar by removing the icons for Legacy Settings (now called Advanced Game Settings), Visual Settings and Startup Menu Settings. These options are still available in the main menu, as always, and are also now accessible in the Game Settings window too:\nNormal Mapping and Material Editing are now available for Sprites, having previously only been available for Tile-Sets, giving you access to custom shaders across the board!  They work the same way too! Simply select \"Normal\" from the \"Mapping\" drop down menu to add/edit your Sprite's normal maps. To edit materials, just click the \"Edit Material\" button next to the \"Graphic Scripting\" button to open the Material Editor:\nThis new Actor Graphic Option allows you to create fixed animation speeds, which is something that several users have been asking for. Essentially, this option allows you to specify the frame rate at which the Sprite animation plays at, regardless of its speed.\nWe've updated 001's Debugger with a new \"Performance\" section that lists slow triggers and collisions. We hope this extra feedback will prove useful to those looking to optimise their games for the best possible performance!\nPathfinding (used by AI and for \"Walk to...\" type events) has been greatly improved, resulting in a lot of fixes to issues that have plagued users for some time, including characters teleporting into or getting stuck in nearby collisions.\nAnd lastly, a small but very useful Field option that allows you to create overlaying Fields without them obstructing selectable Fields underneath them!\nAs we mentioned last time, we've created an official 001 Game Creator\naccount where we've been sharing all of your 001 game creations! If you're on Instagram then please feel free to follow us for new posts every Monday, Thursday and Saturday! If you're got a 001 game you'd like us to showcase, then don't hesitate to get in contact with us!\nWe hope you enjoy the latest version and all that it has to offer.

The software had several issues with my system (AMD 8320, Asus 990fx board, MSI 960GTX, 16 gb ram and 2tb drive). The first issue had to do with my account creation and login. There is an option button to keep you signed in after your initial setup. Well, everytime I would shut off steam or my computer, it would not allow me to log back into driver fusion the next time around. The account would go back to the Free version and ask me to sign in, which I would spend the next 5-10 minutes trying to do because the software would not allow me too since it mentioned that I was signed in somewhere else, but still not give me my premium account. Not sure, but I think this has to do with having to log into STeam to use this software and it's confusing the program.\nThe second issue I had is that the software would lock up on me when ever I would switch from one tab to another. Each time I used the software, I would have to ctrl-alt-delete to get it to stop cycling. This would get extremely annoying because then I would have to go through the whole sign in issue again each time.\nOn another note, I was quite skeptical of the software's ability to get  me the latest drivers in many areas. I downloaded the most recent Nvidia drivers just before installing this software and each time, it would tell me that my video and sound drivers were outdated and would refer to drivers that were outdated. I also ended up not trusting it's ability to FIX the driver issues as well. During my initial use, I was able to get the scan to work, which resulted in about 586 MB download. After turning off the video and sound drivers, I had around 146 MB to download, which I did do. It took around 10 seconds to download them and another 15 seconds to fix them all as complete. Wow! Talk about super highway! Not really.....I went into my files and found that the same old driver versions were still in place and nothing was done, but the program would show that there were no issues to fix.\nDriver fusion is a good idea, but the implementation is very poor at this time. I would almost have to say that this should not have been released yet and would have been better off in the Early Access stage or beta. Maybe other people have had better luck with it, but not me.

Broken DRM + Non UAC compliance\nSteam runs under the user account and elevates to administrator with UAC only when it needs to- this is known as UAC compliance and it is a necessary design that ensures safer environments. DriverFusion requires administrative powers to start. This is generally a big no no and would usually earn a big giant FAIL from me, but given the purpose and scope of this program, I can maybe overlook this. However, administrative processes and user processes are not allowed to communicate. Driver fusion starts, asks for elevation, looks for steam (a user process), cannot access it, and silently crashes. This is what we call 'broken by design', and it needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY. Since this is specifically a steam version, the key you get here will not work on the non steam versions that can actually start without crashing.\n*Most Windows users are unaware that they should, or are unwilling to run a User account separate from an Administrative account, which is why this design flaw made it into release, and why many of you will not encounter this issue. While it may not affect YOU personally, please remember that UAC compliance is important and non-complying software should not be left in a broken state.\n2. Unstable + more broken DRM\nI wanted to play around with the program so I ran steam as an administrator and was able to start driver fusion. After running an outdated driver scan, I tried to switch to a different tab within the program and it froze. Actually, the program becomes unresponsive every time I try to access \"device control\", and will crash some time later. When this happens, I restart the program and then cannot access premium features because I'm \"already logged in\" to my driver fusion account. I must wait several minutes before something times out server side and I am allowed to use the program again. If you're going to have \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 DRM, at the very least just give me the option to force logout anyone using my account! Better yet, just use steam's DRM and get rid of your broken filth. We don't need two independent DRM schemes going on here.\n3. Sketchy business practices\nI scanned for outdated drivers and it started telling me a few Microsoft components were \"very outdated\" and I should upgrade to ones by NEC (or other). Newer is not automatically better, and installing the drivers from random manufacturers (on machines that have no hardware from said manufacturer!) is a good way to break things, and introduce stupid-manufacturer bugs and vulnerabilities. This feature of driver fusion is misleading and potentially dangerous- I appreciate that it opens up options for the power user, but it's portraying this stuff as optimal and better than what is currently installed, which is downright lying. This is the sketchy business practice: telling you your system is outdated when it isn't, so it appears to be doing something and the user feels like their purchase is justified. Buyer beware.\n4. Skinned program\nI hate things that don't adhere to the standard UI convention (yes that includes Steam!). Use the native libraries, custom UIs are ugly and cause problems with UI manipulating software.\n--Edit-- 2016/04/29\nI've just noticed that the publisher/developer, Treexy, has commented on my review, demonstrating a continued total ignorance about the functions of UAC, justifying bad decisions with unrelated PR babble, and defending the skinned interface with a lie (or just more ignorance).\nIt should be noted that in the steam thread about the UAC compliance issues, Treexy is ignorant TO THIS DAY about what the problem even is in the first place. And they have the gall to \"give insight\" about how this program is \"UAC compliant\" when the whole issue is entirely because they don't even know what UAC is or what it can do. At this point I'm actually more inclined to believe they're playing dumb because they just don't want to deal with fixing it.\nListen, I'm holding on to this and not demanding a refund, because despite all my complaints, this software does have a place in my bag of Windows related utilities. The caveat here is that I know enough to work around their BS, and for the once every 2 years I need to run this software, it's not the end of the world to boot up steam in my admin account.\nBut as a paid product, I cannot recommend this to anyone. It actively punishes you for securing your computer environment properly, it presents information in a misleading and frankly dangerous way to try and justify its existence to the customer, it's not that stable, it has unreasonable DRM (as if any DRM were reasonable, but I digress) and it's ugly to boot.\n--Edit-- 2017/12/08\nHappened to notice there have been recent substancial updates to the DRM system. The DRM still doesn't work- probably for the same reason as before (usermode steam process can't talk to the admin driverfusion.exe). It does at least run in \"free\" mode now, instead of just crashing.\nI see the developers have gone through the forums and purged threads referencing this bug, including the one I linked above.

I was still in limbo, disciplining myself, and adjusting to\n.\nI like operating more simple constructed decks. It's easy to make mistakes if the deck is too complicated.\nI had two main deck choices. The first was the mainstream Sapphire and Diamond deck. I tried and found it very easy for me to overtime and lose the game, so I choose a more familiar deck (Blood/Ruby Locket).\nI was afraid of candles rush.\nI'm not good at draft, but the process determines what shard is what.\nWhen I was in the draft, I chose what is probably strong.\nThe emphasis is on participation, and the rest is luck. Believe in yourself\u2014that will nurture your own good luck.\nI would refer back to the last question. I think I was mostly lucky. In the preliminary contest, I had no resistance from the rival decks I was afraid of. In the final draft, I got very strong cards. Even though I choose a champion I thought was a mistake (and didn't fit my cards), the last moment unexpectedly brought surprises based on the power of the champion I chose.\nThe HEX Clash\nis back once more!

We have the CCS this weekend, an interview with a HEX Clash champion, and more!\nThis weekend, the top 128 players\nfrom our past ladder season will duke it out in the Cosmic Crown Showdown\n! Saturday, at 9am PT (Worldclock\n), our best players will fight with $5,000 on the line!\nPenta and Hacky will be on the hextcg channel\nto bring you live coverage of the event, so make sure to stop on by and cheer for your favorite players.\nSpeaking of favorites, we have a special treat for you today. KurtisKapahala is the first player to ever take the top of\nHEX Clashes. With such an amazing feat under his belt, we wanted to reach out and learn a little bit more about him. Here's what he had to say:\nI think two important factors that go very underlooked for any type of big event are your mindset and preparation\u2014and when I say preparation I don't mean within the game itself\u2014I mean the actual preparation in your life. It's always good to schedule that you're going to play in an event, rather than join because you're bored and it's convenient. I always make sure to have a healthy breakfast and keep myself well hydrated with my personal cup of tea or coffee to give myself a short boost (though I know it's different for everybody). I also tend to try to go to the gym that morning (or at least do some sort of yoga or short workout in my house if I woke up late) to get the heart rate going a bit and help with the waking up process. The only thing I'm sacrificing is a Sunday afternoon where I don't generally do anything anyways, and I really do enjoy playing card games and competing, so it works out perfect for me. So basically, the TLDR is make sure you ate a healthy meal before playing as you might not have time later, and try to wake yourself up (or take a nap beforehand for everybody outside of North America).\nI've been part of the HEX community since about a week before\nwas released. I remember getting some booster packs to do my first draft that I streamed when it was triple\n, doing maybe 3 or four of them before\ncame out. I've been playing card games since I was 11 or so and always enjoyed anything with a high level of strategy. Without a doubt, though, the HEX community has been BY FAR the best thing I have enjoyed about this game. I started my stream and multiple people were helping me out, giving me advice, and giving me a hard time about my draft picks. I have made good friends in the process of learning from them and sharing ideas.\nI guess I kinda talked about this a little bit during the first question, but I can go into detail about what I do for in-game preparation. For the\nFormat, I felt like I had a big advantage already knowing the mechanics of HEX (since I got a lot of experience playing Sets 5/6 and the amount of time I spend playing the game in general). I am very hands on with keeping a personal journal, and I am always writing down any thoughts I have at any moment. I keep another journal just for HEX. I like to keep tabs on my personal opinion of the archetypes, and I make sure my deck has a way to win against the well known archetypes at a minimum (though you cannot prepare for everything). I write down my experience with cards I find a lot of success with (not just good timing or topdecks, but a general idea of the card's performance). I also write down cards that have been underwhelming, and I always keep notes for everything and go over them while deckbuilding.\nI don't think there is ONE most important thing, but rather there are two of them. The first important thing you need to remember is you're playing this game because you enjoy it and it's fun, not because you're a \"grinder\" trying to crush events. I think that \"grinder mindset\" can cause a lot of negative energy and stress in people which can ruin your experience and cause you to project that onto others. The other thing to keep in mind is how your deck is going to win. Now when I say this, what I mean is that I think too many people focus on things other than winning, such as getting 2 for 1s, drawing lots of cards and creating card advantage, or having crazy combos and doing all these insane things in the game. At the end of the day, your focus should really be on winning. In general, you win by bringing your opponent's health total below 1 (or burying, or other things, but in general it's lethal damage). So, making sure you don't have just a bunch of good troops without evasion/removal/etc is very, very important. You need to understand if your win condition is through overwhelming your opponent (like when I took Furiko as my champion in my second Clash, understanding I needed to create value and overwhelm my opponent with troops as my pool did not have another way to win), playing lots of Flight troops and having removal or bounce to push through damage while having answers for larger ground troops, or a lot of Candlekin as seen in this format. Try to be aware of what other decks are going to have and make sure you have a way to answer that so you can kill your opponent.\nIn the current format, I would have to say my favorite archetype is a Ruby/Wild Gladiator deck as I think it has the most explosive starts, plus you don't rely on two card combinations as much as other decks. I also think in the current state of the limited meta, from my experience, Wild is very very under drafted aside from the transform cards which you don't want in the Blood/Wild Deathcry or Wild/Ruby Gladiator. My second favorite archetype is most likely a tie between Blood/Wild Deathcry and Sapphire/Diamond Fateweave, playing Puff the Rainbow with Frostform/revert synergy.\nI really wish I had one to share with you all, but I never really felt threatened to lose any of my matches. The closest thing I can think of, and I don't remember which match it was, was that my opponent was facing lethal on his opposing turn and played a Brosi-Buk, Mischief Master... only to concede maybe a minute after thinking and looking at his hand. I don't really know if I was just running very very good as I didn't find my sealed pools to be that great, or if I just have more experience understanding card evaluations and the game states better, but I never really had any close matches.\nThe best thing I could give you would be to listen to anybody and everybody's opinion on things, then create your own with your own perspective and experiences from those.\nI really wish the community had more podcasts or content creators/psudo talk shows, because for me personally that was always how I could absorb information, improving my game while also going for a run and being productive outside of sitting down at my PC. It also helps when you know players with more experience coming up. A player by the name AllofYa started chatting with me on my stream and sharing opinions on card choices. We agreed on some as well as disagreed, but I learned a lot. I enjoyed watching his stream\nfor Sets 5/6 to learn about archtypes and to understand that your champion choice was important during your drafting, not just after during deckbuilding. Also, you HAVE to have fun. As soon as you stop having fun, you're no longer going to learn. You will only go into that \"grinder\" mode of expecting results and not gaining anything outside of the result of your play. Finally, don't be afraid to play some PVE. It's really well done and enjoyable.\nThe HEX Clash\nis back once more!

The finale awards 40,000 platinum in prizes each month for a total of 100,000 platinum given out\nin platinum! Bring your best constructed prizes decks for a shot at these great prizes.

I saw a glimpse of it on friend's Xbox 360 in 2010 and was charmed with graphics and it's colors. Their suits, environment... Something attracted me there. I spent a lot of time in this game, sold the console long time ago, but couldn't forget it, wanted to play it again. And was very surprised to know about the port. It looked amazing on PS3 but now with all the resolution and details increased a lot, this game looks just like I imagined it should. All the shiny details and reflections in all their glory. I felt the same with Bayonetta port. It's like a dream came true! Oh, and no more loading screens!!! Thank you very much, developers and publishers, my dear Japanese people who made my childhood happy and made this happen! In all my long gaming life I bought very few games in digital distribution shops. This one I felt I definitely want to have, it really is special for me. It has amazing atmosphere and exploration feeling, great music, mentioned stunning visuals/design and combat system and very good scenario. And a lot of neat small things inside like cooking, quest system etc. The only downside of this game is repetetive enemies on every planet. They are the same, only stronger and of different color. This thing is what makes the initially good and fun battle system repetitive and maybe even annoying later in the game and makes all that collection quest boring.\nWorks like a charm on usual 60hz monitor. Looks very beautiful and runs 60fps without huccups on GTX 1050 2Gb, Phenom II 965 CPU and 8Gb RAM, Windows 10 pro. I don't know about crowdy places and close-up graphics, but in the beginning while walking on Aeos and in battles it takes, as Afterburner utility says, around 1 Gb  of video memory and around 6Gb of RAM. Need to investigate further into the game, but I think it's a very good port.\nI saw a small problem with hair shadows on faces but I hope it's nothing to worry about and will get fixed.", "hours": 28.5, "user_id": "76561198057306377", "username": "oldghost83", "products": 7, "early_access": false}

Vote today.\nFred is the mind behind the awesome community tool, https://hexpvptools.net/. You may have seen them in game or in the forums, laying down hot knowledge about the current HEX meta. Today we are going to take a moment and learn about the man behind the machine:\nI started playing TCGs casually a little over 20 years ago when I was a teenager with loads of free time. While I never played at a competitive level, or even considered myself a skilled player, I've always enjoyed TCGs for the strategic and puzzle aspects of the game. As I grew older, time was less available and I couldn't hang out in card shops anymore, so I stopped playing for several years. Fast-forward to 2013, I read a Penny Arcade comic strip\nabout a certain Cory Jones being literally the devil. That led me to take a look at Cory\u2019s Kickstarter campaign, and I was instantly sold on his dream of making the ultimate digital TCG. Being able to play a deeply strategic TCG from the comfort of my own home was something I didn\u2019t know I wanted until then. I never looked back, and I've been a non competitive and not very skilled player since.\nThe story of Hex PvP Tools started at the launch of\n, when Chris Woods announced the release of the Hex server API\n. With his announcement, Chris jokingly said that this API could help him get better at drafting. I thought about all the data that the API could provide and realized that it could actually help me get better at drafting as well.\nBeing a software engineer with a knack for numbers, I was certain that there could be ways to aggregate the data and dig through the numbers to figure out how the players who were actually good at drafting made their picks. The first iteration of the site running on my desktop was for my own private use, and it was only aggregating draft data. I managed to build a table listing the performance of each card in draft, which I would quickly browse through when drafting to see which card was usually picked first in a given pack. That\u2019s when I realized that there was no reason to keep that data to myself and decided to get a cheap web host and share the tool with the community. Thus, Hex PvP Tools was born with a single page (that page is now known as the card performance tool\n).\nI started receiving feedback from other players who also found the data useful, so I looked at what other information I could get from the draft data and began extracting the performance of champions and shard pairings in draft (which highlighted just how dominant Diamond-Ruby was at the time). Later, I built the draft replay feature. Now, not only could I see how each card performed in a void, I could follow a full draft, pick by pick, and look at each of the 8 players\u2019 choices around the table.\nFeedback from the community kept coming, and I was having fun working with the data. At first, I was collecting all the data that Chris sent my way, but I was only using the things that were relevant to draft because that\u2019s mostly what I play. Every now and then, in various forum threads, people would comment on different topics and say \u201cit would be cool if we had that kind of data,\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re only speculating because we don\u2019t have the data.\u201d Reading those threads, I kept thinking \u201cWait a minute! We do have that data!\u201d So, I started expanding my site with more and more ways to display the data that was available and that the community wanted to see. I expanded the card performance statistics to sealed and evo-sealed gauntlets, and I added a chart to show the level of activity in the game over a period of time. I also upgraded my web hosting package to something a little more hefty to handle the growing database.\nIn October, the second ladder season was coming to an end, and I wanted to grind the constructed latter a bit to get the AA cards offered as progression prizes. Not being a constructed player myself, I wanted to find out which deck performed well at the time, but I found that this information was hard to get and quickly outdated. I looked again at the pile of data that I was receiving and that I wasn\u2019t using yet and figured that I could extract the ladder meta for any given period in near real-time... and so I built the perfect net-decking tool.\nFollowing the release of the ladder meta analyzer tool\n, I noticed some discussions in the forums revolving around people complaining about the meta being stale and the format being solved, while other people argued that it was not the case because the meta in tournaments were likely different than on the ladder but that such data was not easily available. Knowing full well by then that the data was completely available but simply not being displayed in a digestible way, I started listing the final standings of every scheduled tournament in order for the community to have access to the data it needed to keep arguing.\nAnd that\u2019s where we are now. By first trying to gather data to help me draft better and then trying to understand the constructed meta, I ended up building Hex PvP Tools with the objective of making all the data provided by the Hex server API as transparent and accessible as possible. The progression from a single page hosted on my desktop to having to deploy a cluster of servers to crunch all the numbers and support the newer features has been impressive.\nLooking at how it turned out and from a technical standpoint, the feature I love the most (and one I ended up not using even a fraction of what I thought I would) is the draft replay feature\n. Displaying the packs and the picks of all 8 players around a table, one pick at a time, was something that I loved building, and I am proud of the end result. Porting that tool to the draft gauntlets (meaning having to look at all the draft runs and find out which once came from the same pod) was also quite a feat. Unfortunately, the information provided by that tool ended up not being as useful to help me draft better as the card performance aggregation, the draft assistant, or even simply watching streamers play.\nBy November, the\ndraft meta had been pretty much solved, and it was obvious by looking at the raw numbers that, in any given pack, the Diamond and Ruby cards would always end up being the ones with the highest win rate. My card performance tool was no longer providing valuable knowledge while I was drafting, so I tried to push the analysis a bit further by building a tool that hooked into both the client and the server API to show me in real time the data that was relevant to the cards I had in front of me. I wanted to use the data from the cards I passed and the cards that had been passed to me to get the tool to show what signals I had been sending and receiving. The analysis of those signals turned out to be a lot more complex than anticipated, so I put that project on the back burner and opted to have the tool record all the cards that I had seen in the draft so that, when I was in a match, I could know which bombs I had passed in whatever shards my opponent was playing and prepare myself accordingly. Developing and testing this new tool took quite some time because the only way to see it in action was to jump into a draft. After a couple of weeks, I was satisfied with the result and deployed the draft assistant\nto the site on December 1st. As I was composing a message in the forums to announce this new feature, HEX announced that it was turning competitive drafts into gauntlets\n, instantly making a big part of the draft assistant obsolete since the cards that had been passed to the other players were no longer relevant.\n5 days later, when draft gauntlets were actually implemented, about half of my site broke because all the tools that extracted draft data were expecting pod drafts and draft gauntlets were completely different messages. I hesitated for a while on whether I should just drop the whole thing or massively refactor my tools to deal with the new format, and I thankfully ended up deciding on the latter. Those couple of weeks were pretty hectic trying to fix everything while making sure not to lose any data in the process. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s behind me now.\nOn a normal day, the ladder meta analyzer\nis definitely the most popular tool, simply because there are several people who want to grind the constructed ladder but don\u2019t necessarily have the skill to build a tier 1 deck on their own. You can also see new forums threads appear based on data from that list with people commenting on the ladder meta.\nHowever, on the couple of days after a big tournament such as the Cosmic Crown Showdown\n, I see a big surge in traffic on that specific tournament\u2019s result page\nas people want to see the rankings as well as the decklists of the players who performed well.\nOh boy, do I? However, before I talk about any of them\u2026\nAnything I mention here is exploratory. There is no guarantee as to when any of it will get released, or if it ever will.\nOkay, we can proceed.\nFor the past couple of months, I have been pondering on the possibility of training an AI with the draft data, but I never really got around to it (that kind of stuff is like\u2026 really hard). Last week, burgleburgle, a mathematician and research scientist from the community, reached out to me telling me of his wish to train a drafting AI of his own and that he would like to use my data for that purpose. I jumped on the opportunity to delegate the hard part to someone who probably knows better than I do, and we\u2019ve been collaborating on that project. Who knows what will come out of it?\nI would also like to build a Sealed Assistant like I did for the Draft Assistant, which would be a tool that analyzes your sealed or evo-sealed pool and then highlights the viable decks that could be built with them.\nI recently released a feature\nwhere a player could keep a record of all of his limited gauntlet history and records. I would like to do something similar for the constructed ladder too, but getting to the data required to do so is a lot trickier.\nAnd then there are several minor things that aren\u2019t necessarily worth mentioning. Of course, I\u2019m always open to suggestions, and if I see a need in the community that can be resolved with the data I have, I would happily develop a tool for that.\nI can\u2019t say how happy I am that HEX shares all this data with the community, and I\u2019m really glad people find the tools that I build useful. I am sure there is still a lot of untapped potential in the data coming from the API, and I would encourage anyone who\u2019s a tinkerer to dream up new ways to use the data and build awesome community tools of their own.\nAlso, whenever people are posting in the forums and feel that having data would benefit the discussion, feel free to tag me in those threads. I will do my best to provide the data you are looking for. Some people have been doing that already, and I\u2019ve enjoyed digging through the database to get the numbers they wanted. I just post the results as objectively as possible and try to not take sides. Feel free to contact me if you have questions about the tools, the data, if you think of a tool I could add to the site, or with any other kind of feedback. My contact info is on the front page of Hex PvP Tools.\nFinally, I'm good with numbers, but I'm bad at design. People have noticed that the visual signature of the site is very basic. If anybody with web design skills is reading this and would like to help make the site prettier, I would definitely welcome the help.\nThe second HexPrimal Immortal Championship tournament\nis coming up June 17th!

This member of our community has the impressive distinction of finishing in the top 10 of the ladder for every single season to date. We thought we would take a moment and get to know the player behind the record:\nI started playing HEX when\ncame out, I found this game when I was browsing through gamerankings and saw that it had a high review. Being a fan of TCG's since I was a kid playing Pokemon with my friends close to 2 decades ago, I was definitely interested in checking what this game was about. And as you can tell, I've become a huge fan.\nI'm not sure if there's actually a secret, but a couple of things that I find important (or at least have worked for me) are:\n1) Play a deck you enjoy. If you \"grind\" with something you don't like, you'll find yourself burned out pretty quickly. For the record, actually most of the top 10 players every season don't play particularly fast aggro decks.\n2) Play the probabilities. Know whats popular in the meta, but don't reserve cards just for a bad matchup if its not that popular. It sounds obvious, but its always very tempting after a blowout loss. However, if you try to cover all your grounds, what's going to happen is that while you may eliminate unwinnable matchups, you won't be particularly favored anywhere either.\n3) And of course, play enough matches *wink*\nPlaying skills I believe will come in time with enough experience. What's more important however, is your mindset. It's very important to learn from mistakes rather than blaming RNG, because once you get into that habit you stop improving as a player since you are subconsciously suggesting that you played perfectly.\nAnd this I got from Jeff Hoogland during one of his streams\u2014which I agree with a lot\u2014is if your deck always seems to be on the short end of the stick, its most likely the decks problem and not just 'bad luck.' For me, once I take a few losses in a row, I always take some time to tune my deck.\nI predominantly play tempo or mid-range.\nIf you go up against a player whom you find to be skilled, see if you can get to know them. I was very fortunate to be able to do this early on with Sindharin and Thufirhawat. I learned a lot from them in the many times we played against each other.\nFinally, just be passionate about the game. This goes for outside HEX too, to be successful at something you need to have passion. People who are good at what they do tend to take pride in their work. How I play HEX is a reflection of how I approach my daily life. Stay humble, stay hungry.\nI would just like to thank everyone that made HEX what it is today\u2014Cory and all his staff, as well as, of course, this community, which is honestly an awesome bunch.\nThe HEX Clash\nis back once more!

On this show, HEX staff will play games, talk about HEX, and maybe even do a sketch or two. Make sure to stop by if you want to have a good time and get to know the minds behind this game we all love. Our first stream will start next week on 5/24\u00a0(Worldclock\n).\nThrawn is a player who has been with us since the very beginning. You may have seen them in game, on stream, or in the forums. Today we are going to take a moment and learn about a project he has been working on, Dungeon Masters of Entrath:\nMy HEX user name is a tribute to Grand Admiral Thrawn, who is a tactical genius and my favorite Star Wars character. I hope to someday match his level of brilliance with my HEX play. (Given my win rate, I have a long way to go!) When I'm not playing HEX, I'm an avid achievement hunter on Xbox (my gamerscore is over 290,000), and I enjoy reading horror and sci-fi. My favorite authors are Stephen King and Timothy Zahn (who first created Thrawn.)\nI rarely go to Kickstarter, but had the good fortune of stumbling upon HEX early in its Kickstarter life. I previously played another major TCG, but had stopped years before because I thought it was way too expensive for the amount of play I got from it. HEX promised quality TCG play, from home, for half or less the cost... with a PVE campaign on top of it! I knew this game was going to be something special, so I dug deep and contributed all I could afford at the time.\nI had the opportunity to take vacation and be a spectator for the HEX $100k Invitational. It was great to meet so many known streamers, players, and HEX staff. I'm pretty introverted (don't let anything you see on stream fool you otherwise), so it was awesome how welcoming everyone was. I felt like I'd been hanging out with friends I'd known for years, even if we'd had little to no prior interaction.\nDungeon Masters of Entrath is a HEX gameshow, which happens every Wednesday night, from 5-8pm Pacific, on my Twitch channel\n. Episodes are later uploaded to YouTube so anyone not able to watch live can enjoy the show at their convenience.\nI take on the role of the Dungeon Master, with a series of decks for players to challenge. If you can best every deck, you win the grand prize! Lose any game along the way and it's Game Over, and the prize pool grows for the next challenger. Once someone has defeated the dungeon, we start a new series of encounters. Some dungeons have 4-5 decks that can be faced in any order, while others come with a map I show on stream that has different paths players can explore. This is 1-on-1, private match PVP, with as much PVE-like flavoring as I can give it. Contestants have won drafts, primal packs, boosters, and more for defeating me.\nWe have a thread in the official forums\nwhere players can leave me feedback on the show, and see the rules for the current dungeon.\nTo participate, players should review the rules for the current dungeon. All you need to do is make a deck (or multiple) that comply with the rules, and then let me know in Twitch Chat you wish to challenge the dungeon. Some dungeons have allowed all cards, but lately I have been designing dungeons around allowing contestants to use Common and Uncommon cards only while I use some Rare or Legendary cards to provide that \"AI Only Card\" PVE feeling. I feel like that makes the experience more accessible for all players - old and new alike. If I start getting more interested people than I can fit in a 3 hour stream, I will start doing a gameshow-like lottery to determine who is the next contestant, but so far everyone who shows up with a deck has been able to play.\nI have wanted to stream more HEX for a while, but I wanted to do something unique that would set it apart from other HEX streams people could be watching. I really love all the things HEX is able to do as a digital card came and wanted to have some way to have fun in non-traditional formats using the cards I already own. A gameshow seemed to me like the best way to get to make some unusual decks that would never otherwise see play and motivate others to do the same. Plus, with some prizes on the line and constantly changing formats, that adds some excitement and drama to the proceedings!\nI felt there is a gap for players who want to play the game, are done with PVE, and who aren't yet interested in limited play or the competitive ladder. I wanted to try to help full that niche.\nI love interacting with my viewers and contestants. A lot of players challenging the dungeon buy into idea they are seeking glory and challenging an \"evil\" Dungeon Master, so we engage in some pretty hilarious role-playing / trash-talking. (All in good fun, of course!)\nIt's also amazing when players challenge a dungeon with a deck I had never even considered. I'm inspired and get ideas from what people use to take me out. There's so much creativity in the HEX community, and players are great about finding ways to break every challenge I set before them. I spent a couple hours making 5 different mono-shard decks for a dungeon, only for BirthingPodder to come in and defeat them all with five different mono-shard decks of their own... on the first try. It was pretty impressive!\nWhat you see on stream is only a fraction of what goes into making a community contest work. On the content production side, I need to design a dungeon concept, then the decks, write a rules update so players know how the dungeon is going to work, and then review everything to make my best judgement on how well the content is balanced. It also takes time to design the stream layout, and promote the stream, to try to grow a following. For every hour you see me streaming Dungeon Masters of Entrath, I spent an hour or more getting things ready.\nSurprisingly, the hardest thing about running the contest is managing my lengthy list of decks in-game, because I don't delete them after a dungeon has been cleared in case I want to do \"flashback\" dungeons and revisit past decks. Deck folders to better manage my collection is on my wishlist.\nBuilding dungeon decks, while time consuming, has been more fun than I expected. It's fun to seek out some under-played cards or champions and then figure out how I can make those work for an interesting dungeon encounter. I even have a Daughter of Stars deck!\nDon't be intimidated! I strive to cultivate a very laid-back atmosphere on the show. Please don't be concerned about how \"well\" you do. Several players have lost on the first room of a dungeon, and a few dungeons have taken players collectively over a dozen attempts to clear. Of course it's fun to win on a gameshow, but at heart, Dungeon Masters of Entrath isn't about winners or losers, or analyzing optimum lines of play. This is a show about having fun and seeing what crazy things we can make happen. Whether you have been playing since Alpha, or downloaded the game last week, I want you to have a good time!\nI have recently also starting doing what I call \"HEXercise\" streams, where I stream HEX while walking on a treadmill. I thought this might be a fun way to try to be more active and work on my personal weight loss goals. I was pretty nervous the first time I did it, but those who have stopped by have been very supportive, which helps motivate me to keep doing those. It's another way to have fun, be weird, and provide a unique HEX viewing experience.\nThe HEX community has so many awesome people in it, and Dungeon Masters of Entrath has been a fun way to give back to a community that's always been great to me. I hope to see more of you facing me in the dungeons in the future!\nThe HEX Clash\nis back once more!

As a driving enthusiast that goes to the track once every couple months, I will tell you right now, get this game because they have nailed the performance, sound, feel, and design of the real vehicles. The force feedback and physics are downright spot on. I do have to admit you do need a minimum $300 wheel setup to feel these aspects. But I tried with an older budget wheel I had, and its still great.\nPros:\n- The most realistic graphics out there for sim racer. (Notice I said realistic, not best).\n- Awesome physics (Except in Multiplayer, see Cons).\n- Great Driver License system for the clean drivers out there.\n- Online mode gets really intense in a very good way.\n- Detailed design of every single livery you choose.\n- Much improvements over PC1.\n- Magnificent optimization by the devs. Get solid 60fps on ultra, With 30 other cars on screen.\n- Realisitc penalty system (but see cons also).\nCons:\n- Buggy penalty system. Other drivers may hit you, and both of you will get the penalty. Needs improvment for sure.\n- Buggy sync issues when the race is starting online mode.\n- Buggy country flag and name display in online mode. Sometimes your flag and name change position with others.\n- Buggy and laggy servers throw off your drive online.\n- Horrible CRASH Physics when playing online. You may tap a car and the vehicle goes flying in the air. Needs patched.\n- And the only non online con is that the AI is very boring. No emotion, no aggression, just plain.\n- Game crashed and froze on me 2 times in my first 60 hours of gameplay. Only in the menu.\nBy all means, if you are into Need for Speed and Drive Club (Arcade) type of racers, you may want to pass this game because of its realistic features. For those of you in the reviews who complain that the vehicles feel like they are moving in slow motion, its because either you never been to a track, or you are used to doing 220mph on city streets in other arcade style car games.\nI would Also like to see better physical damages on the vehicle, like actually totaling a car by doing 100mph into a wall, instead of the bumper and hood getting dents. I know this is not BeamNG, but how awesome would it be to see BeamNG crash physics in here. Maybe in PC3? Hopefully.\nOne last side note, I am somewhat related to J.C Agajanian, and I was shocked to see the Agajanian Brand 1963 Watson Roadster to be in the game. How awesome was this. His heritage is almost forgotten, and it really shows the depth these devs at SMS went through to bring these historic vehicles to us also. +100 cookie points for the devs.\nOverall - 9/10 will skid and pray my car stops in time before a corner.", "hours": 84.9, "username": "Vano of Velen", "products": 22, "early_access": false}

Game is fun, it's NOT paytowin, which if anyone understands how much work goes into making games like Battlerush, then will understand its a GEM. Besides, all the DLCs COMBINED add up to $10, which you still have to gather resources so it is not a autowin button.\nI think the Dev is trying to combine all the things that we love about modern combat titles, thats not featured in a single title.\nHere we go; It has base building, but its not OVERwhelming like foxhole(foxhole is TOO MUCH behind the scences boring\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665logistics).  It has good ole Allied vs Axis(The japs are coming in an addon I'd bet) this is a plus, i hated the fake factions in Foxhole.  Combat is good, standard stuff. Hopefully the Devs have played squad and try and emulate the sound of that game, which IMHO puts it in a class all its own.  Devs, you are headed in a good direction with the art, I would aim towards gritty cartoon and away from the cartoon battlefield I played when I first got steam in 2008.  Cartoony graphics means that you can still play with friends on all spectrums of machines, ie cartoony is less hard on your hardware, but do NOT take it anymore that direction please devs.\nDEVS please stear towards gritty artwork(think hardcore GIJOE punk), keep the DLCs cheap, promote Squad persistance, stats, league play, somesort of ingame currency rewards for winning, its needs an EGO hook - like in depth - player ranking through a highly detailed scoreboard.  In game currency like WorldofTanks(clanwars, {biggest EGO hook ever}), this game has some SERIOUS potential.  I love the fact it is NOT grindy like HERO's and Generals, although the persistance of Hero's is fantastic.\nThings that would be cool:\nAI squad control with the ability to control and outfit individual squad members(like that free co-op alien shooter).  Squad members have learning AI and will learn how you play and have adaptive qualities.  Adaptive AI is less code with more variance in game play, DEVS need to focus on smart bots so game still plays well with the occasional low population.\nCool REALISTIC sound, with realistic ballistics and realistic pentration(play SQUAD for a weekend) the sound is amazing and really puts you IN the WAR.\nBetter Persistance, like Hero's and Foxhole, needs EGO hooks.\nOFF to buy all the DLCs, spread the word troops - if the DEVs listen to playerbase, then have a diamond here!", "hours": 12.3, "user_id": "76561197981716582", "username": "LavaJava", "products": 215, "early_access": true}

Everything is fresh and you are ready to climb anew! Compete for cosmetics, packs, and gold\u2014not to mention that animated sleeve for those who make it all the way up to cosmic.\nRead more here\n.\nHey all, Corey Burkhart here to discuss an issue with the Ladder results for Season 1 of 2017. As a part of the transfer from the Gameforge servers to the HEX Entertainment servers, there were some issues reporting the standings and results of the ladder.\nThe issue spawned during the server transfer. If a player played a game before verifying their Keep Name (in-game name) on the new HEX entertainment servers, their rating was saved to the false name that the servers used to protect the privacy of these players. Then, when their new name was re-established, the database pulled a rating at random to associate with the player. Thus, some players saw that their in-game rating was much lower than they anticipated.\nWith some effort, we were able to backtrack over the last week and correct for the ratings that were off. With this data, we were able to solve which players should have ended in Cosmic at the end of the season in both the limited and constructed ladders. This issue has been solved in the database now, and players don\u2019t need to worry about the current 2017 Ladder Season 2 data being collected.\nThe final corrected standings can be seen here\n.\nTo those players not on these leaderboards\u2014but who were shown on the leaderboards in client at the end of 2017 Season 1\u2014you will also be qualified for the upcoming Cosmic Crown Showdown. We determined that it would be unfair to these players who believed that they had earned a spot in the CCS to exclude them from the event. These players\u2019 names are posted below each list for which they qualified.\nWe apologize for the issues. These have been corrected going forward. Congratulations once again to the winners and good luck next weekend in the Cosmic Crown Showdown!\n~Corey Burkhart\nGot any questions? Want to chat with other players?

Blood and earth conspire to trap you in their clammy embrace, but despite the burning agony in your side and the dwindling strength in your limbs you manage to flip yourself onto your side. The rust colored sky matches the stained field below, like the heavens themselves bled too.\nThe battlefield is still, save for the terrible squawking of hungry crows, but you can\u2019t stop hearing the cries of the fallen in your mind. So many gone. Tears trickle down your face, but whether they are for Prince Talysen or yourself you do not know. Everything smells like copper.\nSuddenly, you hear a rustling and the flap of hundreds of angry wings disturbed from their meal. A bony hand grips your shoulder and flips you onto your back. You recoil, your already shallow breath catching in your throat as you catch the glint of Diamonds where eyes should be. Something glimmers in those depths, and your skin crawls with the sensation that the stones are\nyou. With as much bile and hatred as you can muster, you choke out one word, \u201cNecrotic.\u201d\nMadam Anana stares down at you, head cocked to the side as if she were listening to something. Her feathered collar and tattered cloak are somehow spotless, as if she were somehow standing above the carnage all around her. For a moment, there was silence. Then Anana spoke, her words echoing slightly as if a dozen voices lived within, all clamoring to get out.\u201cWe knew the shin\u2019hare were up to something when they gave us your prince. Bloodshed. Chaos. War.\u201d\nHer face twists slightly as she looks down at you, her eyes burning like twin stars in the face of a disapproving grandmother.\u201cBut war was an acceptable price to pay, Sleeper. What were you thinking, burning your dead? Foolish. Selfish.\n.\u201d\nWith each word her voice grows louder, hands clenched and trembling at her sides. \u201cYou are like children, breaking your toys because you do not want to share. All that knowledge, all those Orphaned shards without a home because of your stubborn pride. We need your shells, Sleeper. If you will not gift them to us after you are done with them, we have no choice. We will take them by force.\u201d\nA crow lands on her staff, breaking her tirade. She looks up at the human finger clutched in its beak, and then out at the blood-soaked battlefield.\u201cThis was not my first choice,\u201d she whispers. \u201cBut even if these scars go deeper than we intended, we will fulfill our purpose.\u201d\nHer eyes flash as her thin hands go to a pouch at her waist.You feel your vision dim as Anana leans over you, her dry breath in your ear.\u201cShh\u2026 sleep, young one. Soon you too will hear the Chant. Awaken, and this will all be like a bad dream.\n*********\nIt\u2019s a new year and a new expansion!

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 15, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "text": "Hello HEX players!!! We have some very exciting news about HEX\u2014we have begun self-publishing!\nI know this was already stated in the general press release\n, but I want to repeat: This will NOT change the core elements of HEX.\nThere will be some minor tech elements to the transition, as is expected. We will have new billing arrangements, there will be a small downtime as we make the actual transition, and there may be a few other slight adjustments. But, overall, it should feel relatively seamless and nothing in your actual collection is in danger of changing or being lost.\nMost importantly, I am (as I have always been) in control of the game and its direction. You can continue to be sure the well-being of HEX and the happiness of its players is our number one priority.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank Gameforge for all of their tremendous support. We literally wouldn\u2019t have gotten here without them, and they deserve all of our thanks (they certainly have mine).\nLet me make it clear that HEX is healthy, and we are carefully managing our resources to maximize our success. Running the game intelligently will allow us, with your support, to continue indefinitely. Not many people know this\u2014and I haven\u2019t really made it public\u2014but to date HEX has had over $25 million spent on development. Yes, $25 MILLION! I know, it\u2019s crazy, and I certainly had no idea when I started out that making a game like HEX would be so unbelievably expensive. As it turns out, one of the reasons there are no other great fully-featured digital TCGs out there is because it\u2019s INCREDIBLY difficult and costly.\nBut here we are! With a great game, an amazing engine, and the best community possible. So, let me assure you our continued focus will be on adding new features (we have a long list) and developing amazing card sets. Luckily, we are in the best possible position to make that happen.\nOne of the things I declared when HEX started is that we would only sell packs and decks but, as time rolled on (over three years now), it has become clear that this may not have been the best decision. We regularly see players asking for fun cosmetic additions to the game. We want to add them too. In the past, we've used these items to reward gameplay, but now we want to provide the opportunity for you to buy some of them as well.\nTo be clear, I am only talking about cosmetic items\u2026 and this will help us achieve our goal to increase revenue so that we can continue to improve the HEX experience. As the publisher, we need to carefully manage the day-to-day business and, of course, part of that is watching the bottom line. However, I still want to increase the amount of money we SPEND to make the game better, and increase the number of prized tournaments. To do this, we need to ensure HEX is generating enough revenue to make these great tournaments possible. I would call this an experiment and, if it doesn\u2019t work or players hate it, we can discontinue the practice. One of the things I love most about HEX is the chance to chase crazy ideas, and I don\u2019t think that is going to stop anytime soon.\nSo what are some of the things we are going to try?\nWell, first off, we are starting the HEX CLASH\n, a weekly limited format tournament with $1000 in cash prizes and some pretty insane in-game rewards! Trust me when I say the cash will be secondary when you see the in-game stuff. One fun thing we are doing is giving fantastic prizes to lucky tournament players as a participation prize each week!\nNext, we have created a COLLECTOR\u2019S DECK, which will be a very special pre-constructed deck that features several alternate arts, our first ever AAA card (Animated Alternate Art), AND an animated sleeve. It should be very, uh\u2026 collectible!\nWe are also adding the \u201cCHARK MART,\u201d a new tab in the store that will sell all kinds of fun stuff. The first big addition is collectible Battle Boards. To begin with, it will be one board a month (available for a very limited time), featuring each of the boards we have created for the PVE campaign.\nThere will also be more items for gold as we look for interesting new sinks. We have the Kismet\u2019s Reserve pack that features a number of in-game items, each built around a specific theme. The first is focused on the Silver Talon and includes a mercenary, alternate art PVP card, a sleeve, and PVE cards/equipment.\nDino has been kind enough to do a more in-depth write-up of all these plans and has posted it here\n. We will also be doing a Q&A stream on the official HEX channel\nstarting at 4pm PT (Worldclock\n). Please leave your questions in this HEX Reddit thread for consideration.\nOverall, I am VERY happy to be publishing HEX. We have some very big plans moving forward and, as HEX continues to grow (the game has gradually grown EVERY month), we will have some great opportunities to be bigger and better than ever. I want to thank you for continuing to support HEX. We love your passion and know that without you we wouldn\u2019t have the chance to spend every day making the game we always dreamed of.\nCory Jones, CEO\nGot any questions?

You can also develop relationships with your crew. Battle is much similar to the 3rd one. I do not have much time on this game for PC, so stability issues I cannot tell you about, however, the game itself I've spent hours on the Xbox playing it. Great game, good story line, Soundtrack in the game is pretty good as well.\nIf you are fan of the star ocean series, I suggest playing this one, It's probably one of the last decent Star Oceans out right now.

Com uma mobilidade incr\u00edvel e especialidade de ataques em \u00e1rea, o Musah se destaca em PvP de pequena escala, mas suas defesas baixas o tornam um pouco mais complicado de ser dominado em PvP de grande escala. O Musah atinge seu auge enquanto avan\u00e7a atravessando o campo de batalha para desferir poderosos ataques em \u00e1rea em seus inimigos, mas cada movimento n\u00e3o calculado pode ser fatal devido \u00e0s suas baixas defesas.\nO territ\u00f3rio de Val\u00eancia traz novos conte\u00fados, conhecimentos, NPCs, monstros e miss\u00f5es.

Today we will cover Flashback Mashups, New Ladder Season Sleeves, our upcoming Platinum Plunder, and more!\nWe want to remind you that our Platinum Plunder tournament\nis\n! Starting December 17th, make sure to join us for a massive, free tournament with several hundred thousand platinum up for grabs! Additionally, the top 256 players will receive the Salty Sam mercenary (shown below).\nBegin brewing your boarding party today!\n\u00a0\nWe hope you have been enjoying our Flashback tournament event! The\nand\nEvolving Gauntlet will be closing Monday 12/19 at 10am PT (Worldclock\n).\nBut the Flashback fun is far from finished! We have put together a unique play experience from a bunch of our old sets for you all to enjoy. In this mashup mode, players will get \u201cStandard Gauntlet Packs,\u201d which are made up of random cards from across all 5 sets. As in a normal Evolving Sealed Gauntlet, two of your packs from your initial pool will have rares and three will not. Players who reach 1 and 3 wins respectively will have another Standard Gauntlet Pack added to their pool, rare included. Players who reach 5 wins will receive 1\nbooster pack.\nIn this mode, you will be able to play with all our champions, though gems will be restricted to those legal in the current standard format. We hope you enjoy this wacky sendoff to an epic year for HEX. See you on the battlefield!\n\u00a0\nThis past week we ran some polls on the forums to let you all help decide what our upcoming ladder sleeves will be. These beautiful pieces of art were selected as the 2017 Season 2 and Season 3 sleeves respectively.\nThis is also the first official look at content from our upcoming set. I wonder what their abilities could be.... If you have a guess, make sure to share it in the forums. Enjoy!\n\u00a0\nHEX has been nominated for both the Best PC Exclusive and the Game of the Year categories in Game Informer's 2016 Games of the Year\npoll. Voting ends today, so if you think we've been doing a pretty good job make sure to let them know!\n\u00a0\nThere is something special about being the first person to scale Mt. Everest. I think it scratches that itch we have as people and as gamers - that drive to experiment and explore. We wanted to take a minute and shout out those players who have boldly gone and conquered a few of the hidden fights we sprinkled throughout the Alachian Sea:\nCongratulations and well done!

Our teams have worked really hard to bring you this epic introduction to our second chapter.

Additionally, the top 256 players will receive the Salty Sam mercenary (shown below).\nSave the date and begin brewing today!\nYou may have noticed that we are transitioning to a brand-new website. This is a big change, but it comes with some pretty sweet improvements.\nFirst, we have a brand-new slider for our top news stories. If something important is going down in the world of Entrath, we want you to know about it. With major articles pinned right at the top of the page, it is now easier than ever to stay informed!\nSecond, we know that you don't all read our news feed every day. Sometimes you miss an article or a deck write-up by one of your favorite community authors. With our previous website, once something fell off the front page it could be difficult to find it again. Not any more! We now have both a search function and a tagging system to make navigating our archives an easy and pleasant experience.\nThird, we have added a new \"What is HEX?\" video which can be found under 'the game\n' menu on our website. If you have some friends who are thinking of getting into HEX, we now have a short, accessible introduction they can watch to see what kinds of things our game has to offer.\nWhat is HEX Video?\nPlease note that this is just the beginning! We are still adding features to our new website and tweaking its look. While we are in our transitional period, some older articles may be down until we can get them into our archive properly. Thank you for your understanding!\nFinally, we posted full details regarding our Season 3 Cosmic Crown Showdown\n.

Should one or more of the finalists fail to show up for Stage 2, the 9th placed player will have a chance to join (2 minute response limit), before the 10th placed player will have a chance to do so (2 minute response limit). After this, the tournament will commence, even if there are fewer than 8 players present to avoid long wait times for the finalists.\nPlayers who qualified for the final stage but don\u2019t show up will be rewarded with the in-game rewards corresponding to the 9th place of Day 1.\nFull Terms and Conditions will be available here shortly.\nWill you be the next to wear the Cosmic Crown?

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 20, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "text": "For the past year we have been watching everyone\u2019s experiences in HEX, and based on that data have decided to make a change to our shuffling algorithm. \u201cOpening Hand\u201d changes will be coming with our Chapter II update!\nCurrently, when you sit down to play a game of HEX, we randomize your entire deck. You then draw a hand equal to your starting hand size (usually 7 cards). This system is exciting because it forces players to overcome variance every game, but it also leads to an exceptionally wide range of hands. The mulligan system (which lets players redraw a new hand with one fewer card) helps get rid of hands that are on the unacceptable end of that variance, either because of too many resources, too few resources, an unacceptable curve, wrong threshold, or any number of deckbuilding considerations. However, that variance mitigation comes at a price. Mulligans can be punishing through the loss of one or more starting cards and so act as a double-edged sword.\nWhile we like the risk-reward and skill testing nature mulligans offer, we felt that players were forced to redraw hands too often when they had too few resources or too many resources in our current system. A mulligan is interesting when it adds to the overall strategy of the game by presenting interesting choices. A zero shard hand, typically speaking, is not a choice. As such, we are changing the opening hand algorithm so it will remove the most resource dense and least resource dense hands from your possible range of draws. This is accomplished by taking a hypergeometric distribution of your deck and eliminating a percentage of your hands that include the greatest and fewest number of resources.\nNote, this change doesn\u2019t completely eliminate the possibilities to draw a hand with too few resources or too many. We are not guaranteeing players will have 2-5 resources in their opening hand, nor are we guaranteeing you will draw an opening hand with fewer than 7 resources if you still put 50 resources in your 60 card deck. Conversely, if you put 5 resources in your 60 deck, we won\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t draw an opening hand with 0 resources. The algorithm would actually bias to making this more likely because drawing a shard in that scenario would be an outlier. If you\u2019re looking for more information, Chris Woods, our Lead Engineer, will be posting the exact algorithm in the forums for those looking for the nitty-gritty on how hands are altered.\nYou should note that our algorithm doesn\u2019t look at the threshold requirements of your cards or their cost. It only looks at the number of resources in your deck and the number you draw. The algorithm does not change the context of your deck either. While your opening hand is less random now with regards to resources, the order of the remaining cards in your deck is still the same. Each card has an equal likelihood of being the top card of your deck as well as any other spot in your deck, and resources still clump naturally over the course of the game.\nIt took us a while to determine the best output to reduce the number of times players were experiencing a frustrating redraw moment while still preserving the tactical redraw. HEX is all about playing skillfully through variance. We wanted to preserve the option for players who drew sub-optimal hands for their strategy or matchup to still play the odds and make use of a mulligan.\nAt the same time, we didn\u2019t want to drastically change how people build their decks. We didn\u2019t want a situation where putting 2 or 3 resources in a 60 card deck was optimal because some percentage of those were guaranteed. We still want to preserve the tension and excitement of not knowing if you will hit your resource drops every turn.\nThere were a number of different systems that we tried before deciding on this one. We tried the campaign free mulligan system. We tried selecting a number of cards in your hand to toss back and redrawing that same amount. We tried a mulligan where you could redraw your hand once but also keep any resources that were in your opening hand. We even tried guaranteeing a resource in your hand regardless of your deck. At the end of the day, we decided that an algorithm which adjusts based on your resource count is the best solution because it checked a few key boxes for us.\nAt the end of the day, we found an approach that didn\u2019t require players be concerned that something changed. If you have no idea that we\u2019ve improved the system and you\u2019ve been out of HEX for months, everything will seem completely normal to you. We didn\u2019t want to make it something in your face, and we didn\u2019t want something that completely changed the game engine. That was one of the problems with using the campaign redraw rule - it required players learn a new ruleset and also privileged combo decks over other archetypes. In campaign, it\u2019s alright to have a bunch of wacky, less interactive combo decks running around. The AI won\u2019t mind. However, this is less acceptable in a PvP environment, so we went with a solution that preserved the balance between deck archetypes.\nThis change goes across all formats. Draft, Sealed, Campaign, Constructed, you name it.  We\u2019re confident this change will greatly improve HEX and we don\u2019t want to silo this rule off for only one segment of the community. We want to make sure everyone gets to experience the future where there\u2019s less need to redraw so many hands and more awesome games of HEX.\nThese changes will be going live on launch day of Chronicles of Entrath: Chapter II. If you want to try and feel them out a bit before you get directly into a match, the \u201cTest Draw\u201d feature in collection manager will also be following these rules. You can take your new opening hands for a test drive with this feature.\nWe hope you\u2019re as excited about this as we are. I\u2019m really looking forward to more awesome games of HEX. Until next time, have a wonderful time exploring the Alachian Sea!\n-Corey Burkhart", "early_access": false}

I enjoyed the first PCars, and I love how much is offered in PCars 2. But, it does have its issues.

I use a G29 wheel mostly.\nCons:\nNow, for the cons section I feel like writing is best. The game still has glitches, many really. The cars can easily be destroyed, Indycar the most. But for me, the biggest issues is the AI's consistency. Now, I know having AI trust right if difficult in racing games, but the challenge slider from 10% to 110% is way off. In some series, 70% is too difficult and in others 90% is too easy. At 75%, the AI in the Indycar series is like a bunch of 10 year olds driving blind, and at 90% the cars are a challenge, but forget you're there. That is another thing, no matter what series or aggression level you place the AI, they don't seem to understand that you are under them or above, they will simply turn in and sometimes this crashes you; and with some glitches it can be so annoying.\nOverall, I like this game, I don't love it. My rating would be 7.5/10. F12017 is fantastic, iRacing is still amazing and even rFactor 2 is a great choice for it's price.

If the PC series is the only sim series for you then stop reading here and buy Project Cars 2.\nEveryone else, people that want an exciting, enjoyable, realistic full sim or \"light\" sim (I hate the term Simcade) experience best look elsewhere.\nWhy? Project Cars 2 is dull. While the options on options for options and options on those will get any simmer salivating, that is it. The driving is where it matters and it just doesn't click here. I'm not one to go on and on about tyre friction and suspension and torque and yadadadada, I'm just going to say that it doesn't feel right. It just doesn't feel like other games such as Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 and AMS do (and I'm not a massive fan of AMS).\nSome good points, decent car selection and variety, but some disciplines and groups are very lacking, offering only one or two vehicles. Tracks are good, probably the strongest point of the game. A decent selection of tracks with the \"classic\" Azure Coast from the original, but the rallycross is limited, the ovals are bland, as is the AI.\nThe worse element of this game for me, by far, is the sound design. It. Is. Awful. Nothing more immersion breaking than a monotonal NNNNRRRRRRRRRR while whizzing around the track. Whomever did the sound for PC2 must have had a cold at the time, or an ear infection.\nPC2 also loses out by any substantial modding support outside of car skins. For PC simming this is essential for longevity and versatility, which is why people play the likes of rFactor 1/2, Race07 etc even today. Functionally this is a console title, and as a PS4 owner myself I would think that this is reasonable, but with Assetto Corsa also on PS4, I would buy AC over it.\nSo, no, not for me. Project Cars 2 has the edge with a built in career mode, which for some is essential for that feel of progression. While rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa lack these features stock, they each have mods that add a career progression to them, emulating a season of events with points, and even a iRacing like rating system for online racing.

The Night of Bells is almost here and you just have to see what we have in store for you!\nThe nights may be cold and the future uncertain, but\u2026 are those bells I hear?\nCome in, friend, and sit down! Would you like some Hog Nog or Moose Mousse?\n\u2026no?\nYour loss. This batch turned out extra musky.\n*mmmh* Divine!\nNow, I know times have been hard. Terrible business that, with Talysen and all. But if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from Pappy Jasper it's that, when times are tough, the greatest gift of all are these small moments of kindness. We need a few days to remember our better natures and remind ourselves of what we\u2019re fighting for. Too much darkness is bad for the soul \u2013 you can get lost in there without a little light, y\u2019know.\nSo ring those bells! Maybe we can get that great moose Zeke to pay us a visit. And while we wait, why \u2013 I\u2019ve just the thing! Some stories from the great adventurer Lord Bernard P. Dunthorpe to pass the time.\nLet me just blow this dust off a moment.\n*ah-CHOO*\n...\nHmmm, yes. Here we go\u2026\nThe more I travel around Entrath, the more similarities I see in its peoples. We\u2019ve our differences, to be sure\u2014in creed, shape, and enterprise\u2014but more often than not there\u2019s a thread that connects us all.\nTake the Night of Bells, for example. I remember fondly the stories my father would tell as we curled up by the hearth. Pappy Jasper, the Snow Yeti, whose arrival heralds gifts of dubious delectability, was a tale I\u2019d always thought was confined to the Ardent races. After all, generosity requires a certain nobility in character I\u2019d never thought to see in the more barbarous inhabitants of our planet.\nImagine my surprise when, hacking my way through the Monsagi jungle, I came across a monstrous insect! Six feet tall, its mandibles a-quiver, I thought I\u2019d reached the end of my days. But the manti, I\u2019d soon learn, are a peaceful tribe. I had just begun to plead for my life when they began showering me with gifts! Apparently, they too are inspired by the tale of ol\u2019 Pappy.\nSince then, I\u2019ve even heard tales of dwarves celebrating with fireworks during this festive season. How you can tell the difference between those and the normal explosions they leave in their wake is beyond me, but nothing would surprise me at this point. The world is a big place, and we are all Entrathians.\n-\nDuring the winter holidays, you will get the gift of a Pappy Jasper sleeve for coming in from the cold. (Simply log in and you will automatically receive the sleeve!)\nIf you decide to let your slay bells ring, you will earn the Gift of the Manti AA card for playing in draft, evo, and sealed tournaments. (Enter a tournament and earn your reward!)\nPlaying in dungeons across Entrath can grant players the Pappy Jasper card and its equipment pieces, the\nand\n. 'Tis the season for sending and receiving cards, after all. Visit your favorite dungeons and grab a gift!\nTo earn these rewards, champions must defeat any dungeon during the Night of Bells holiday:\nThe first time a player logs in during this holiday, they will receive the Pappy Jasper sleeve.\nAll tournaments will have a participation prize of an AA Gift of the Manti card. Basically, enter a tournament, get the card.\nPlayers that win a constructed ranked ladder match will have a 25% chance of earning an AA Gift of the Manti card.\nPlayers can earn PvE items by playing in campaign dungeons. There is one card and two equipment items to earn. By defeating any dungeon you will earn one of the three items at random. Each of them has a percent chance to drop: 15% on the Rare equipment, 25% on the Uncommon equipment, and 60% on the card.\nDeck the halls between Monday, December 19 at 10am PT (Worldclock\n) and Monday, January 2 at 9:59am PT (Worldclock\n).

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 21, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "text": "Hey everyone, Corey Burkhart back to share with you a feature I\u2019ve been working on for a long time now, Draft Gauntlets! Draft has been a fan favorite format ever since HEX was in alpha. One of the issues with draft, however, was the time commitment required to play.\nA problem we observed with a traditional draft was that you were bound by the tournament structure. If you finished early or got a bye, you were forced to wait until everyone else finished their games. This resulted in a lot of downtime for players. You were also unable to play at your own pace. Unless you had three hours to complete an entire draft in one sitting, you were unable to enjoy this unique limited experience. Draft Gauntlet fixes these problems!\nGauntlet is a mode where, once you have your cards for your deck, you can play at your own pace and finish your tournament experience when it\u2019s most convenient for you. We wanted to preserve the convenience of a Gauntlet but also allow the exciting deckbuilding that comes from choosing the cards in your pool. That being said, we faced a large hurdle. Draft is inherently a multiplayer experience. It takes 8 players opening packs and choosing cards to form a draft.\nDraft Gauntlet starts by selecting the tournament queue and joining the lobby. From here, you\u2019ll wait until a full 8 players enter the queue. Once all 8 players enter the draft, the drafting portion will begin. Just like a current draft, you\u2019ll select cards one at a time until you\u2019ve drafted 51 cards. Then, once everyone has selected their last card, you\u2019ll be taken to the Draft Gauntlet Tournament screen.\nThis tournament screen has many similarities to the other gauntlets in HEX, but it has one key difference. The record counter at the bottom has a few modifications. In a Draft Gauntlet, rather than playing up to seven matches like you would in a sealed (competing to earn five wins or three losses), you instead cap out at three matches, similar to an old draft tournament. You are removed from the Draft Gauntlet after either completing three matches or losing two.\nEach match in a Draft Gauntlet is best two out of three games and, like a normal draft, you can use your reserves between games. In between matches, you can change your champion just like you can in any other gauntlet. However, you cannot change your champion in between games just like in previous drafts.\nDraft gauntlet still incorporates the ladder system. Therefore, if you win your match, you\u2019ll earn stars and rating towards your ladder ranking. Any bonus stars you can earn are also integrated into this game mode.\nDraft Gauntlet cost will not be changing. You can enter with 700 platinum or up to three packs, each pack reducing the cost to enter by 200 platinum each. You can still join a Draft Gauntlet with draft tickets as well. The prizes however are slightly different than that of a normal draft. Because we don\u2019t only pair people within the same draft pod, there\u2019s no longer a winner of the draft. It\u2019s possible for everyone in a single pod to end up undefeated at the end of their three rounds. Therefore, having prizes based on what place you finish in the draft doesn\u2019t really make sense. Instead, we need to do prizes based on final standings. We didn\u2019t want to lower the packs that players earn, therefore we\u2019re keeping a grand total of 12 packs in the prize pool.\nPrizes will now be paid out as follows:\n3 Wins = 6 Packs\n2 Wins = 2 Packs\n0-1 Wins = 0 Packs.\nIn the event that there are promo or alternate art cards to be earned by players, those will be layered on top of these prizes.\nWith the release of Draft Gauntlets with Chronicles of Entrath: Chapter II, we\u2019ll be closing the remaining draft queues. These queues are fairly obsolete verses the technology of the gauntlets.\nWhen testing this mode, we saw very minimal changes to the drafting portion when compared with a traditional draft. One thing we did notice is that there is less of an incentive to \"hate draft.\" Hate drafting is when you take a card you don\u2019t intend on playing to make sure no one else at the table can get the card. We believe that the benefits of our gauntlets outweigh this loss, as common draft strategy says that you should take the card that will make your deck the best it can possibly be because you\u2019re so unlikely to battle the player with any one powerful card. And, even if you do, they must draw that card during the course of the game for it to make a difference. Our testing shows that Draft Gauntlets promote better play patterns because they emphasize making the best, most flexible deck possible rather than trying to take something away from other players.\nFurthermore, the payoff for this minor change is huge. Draft Gauntlets gain a vast amount of time for everyone involved. Currently, drafts can take anywhere from two hours on the short end to four hours on the high end. With Draft Gauntlets, we expect this time to shrink drastically. There\u2019s no more time waiting in between rounds like in a normal tournament. Once you\u2019re ready to play another match with your draft deck, you are able to get in there and battle. When you\u2019re ready to take a break, you can go do other things in HEX or the real world, and your deck will be waiting for you when you come back! The convenience is truly massive. I think everyone will really appreciate the time they\u2019ve gained once they see the Draft Gauntlets in action.\nAlso, from the Chapter II patch until the release of our next major set, anyone who goes 3-0 in a Draft Gauntlet will receive The Kraken Alternate Art!\nDraft Gauntlets are something I\u2019ve spent a lot of energy on, and I\u2019m really excited that you are going to get your hands on them soon. We\u2019re hoping this brings draft to thousands more players who wouldn\u2019t otherwise give this fantastic game-mode a chance because of the time constraints that traditional drafts have. When you\u2019re not out there on the Alachian Sea, I\u2019ll be seeing you in a Draft Gauntlet!\nCorey Burkhart\n--\nDue to this being an important and large change to the game, we encourage our community to provide us their feedback on the official Hex forums.

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 22, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "text": "Hey all, Corey Burkhart here with another \"Makings\" article for HEX. Usually I talk about making cards, but with the Chronicles of Entrath: Chapter II just around the corner, I wanted to do something special. Rather than share just one campaign card or just one champion, I instead want to share how we make an encounter and how that encounter fits into the campaign experience as a whole.\nOne of the encounters that I think highlights this is the second encounter node you\u2019ll experience on the Alachian Sea - Captain Chumspike! Captain Chumspike and his dastardly band of minotaur pirates attempt to fight you for rowing onto their territory. We knew that we wanted Captain Chumspike to fall in line with the Minotaur lore of being pirates and mercenaries. As such, we tried to make that ring through in the champion and the deck. Here was our first take at Captain Chumspike many moons ago:\nBefore the creative team\u2019s pass, we had Captain Chumspike\u2019s name as a placeholder as you can see. However, the art shown here is a bit later in the process so it's a touch more polished. The initial concept for Captain Chumspike was to give the feeling that he\u2019s a ruthless ruler of the seas, an unstoppable force that you can't defeat. The best you can hope to do is survive with your vessel and your life. The design you see here does succeed in that goal, but it does so in an exceptionally mechanical way. A player has to enter into the encounter and read all of Chumspike's special rules text to understand the way to win.\nThis is not ideal for getting players enthralled with the campaign experience. One of our goals with any content, but campaign specifically, is making you feel like you ARE the character. We want to give the sense that you could be part of the encounter, duking it out on the high seas. When you read a champion with text like this, you instead get pushed into the meta mode of mechanics. Chumspike's first pass asked players to do a small reading comprehension quiz instead of being entertained by the content around them. Improving immersion and bringing the content directly to the players was one of our goals to improve for Chapter II.\nChumspike wasn't clicking just yet, so we put a bookmark on his encounter design and dove down into the specifics of his deck. After the design team gets back from laying out the overarching story of our chapter, we build out the specific encounter decks so they\u2019ll see how many new cards some of the decks will need. We aim to use most of our new cards for dungeon nodes, player rewards, and highly specialized encounters, but we also want to make sure that each node has its own piece of novelty. This often means that even a single encounter within a chapter could have its own card, and many times players can earn these cards for themselves. I\u2019m a big fan of the one we included in Chumspike's deck because it embodies strongly what the minotaurs in Entrath are up to on the Alachian Sea. I think many players will be interested in collecting him, either for their decks, their mercenary decks, or both.\nThis card was designed early in the process. We knew we wanted aggressive pirates that would board your boat and try and take over like in the quintessential pirate movies or novels. When designing PvP cards, we usually focus on balance between the two realms of constructed and limited. When it comes to campaign cards, there is a touch more freedom. Cutthroats are fast, mean, and scarier than most things you would see in PvP. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t worry about the raw power level of the cards that we\u2019re making, but the focus is less about keeping power in check and more about making tons of exciting options and challenges for our players. After all, the AI won't complain, no matter how many times you punch it in the face.\nWith Hired Horn Cutthroat I think we met our design goals fairly well on the first shot. We have a card that's exciting to collect, that\u2019s challenging to play against in its specific encounter deck, and that fits right in with the minotaur pirate theme. We don\u2019t have an exact term for this in R&D, but it\u2019s been an ongoing joke that designs that can enter the file as one design and go out to the internet as the same design are A+++ designs. We seldom make those and it\u2019s not something we strive for, as there are many good reasons a design can change from start to finish, but I think the guys did a bang up job with this card. That might not seem like that much since the card is quite simple, but it\u2019s truly very difficult to make a card one time and have it enter the game unchanged.\nAs we moved into the testing phase of Chapter II, most the team was in the client playing games and making sure everything plays well. We were busy tweaking the encounters and making things feel correct within the games themselves. While we were busy with that, other departments were hard at work also. The engineers came back to us with some sweet new technology they had been working on while the art team continued to evolve the look of our cards:\nThe engineers told us about encounter dialogue. Essentially, the ability to spawn conversations in the middle of the game was a power they had moved into our clients and we could use at will. Rather than putting a ton of work onto campaign engineers, we now had the power ourselves to set these interactions up. These conversations are just like the dialogues you\u2019ll have on the campaign map, in panoramas, or in dungeons, but they can happen dynamically during a battle. Here\u2019s a sneak peek at the conversation as you\u2019re escaping Captain Chumspike and his dirty group of minotaur bandits:\nWhat this does is at certain points in an encounter based on event, we can spawn a dialogue between any number of different characters. This was immensely helpful for us in increasing the immersion of our campaign. No longer would we need champions that looked like that first version of Hired Horn Captain. Instead, we can remove most of his complicated text and have the encounters hide or reveal some of the mysteries of the battle as it unfolds. This is similar to how we have battleboards affecting the encounters themselves, but is presented in a more interactive and engaging form.\nAfter a couple more iterations where the team tested out various ideas for the encounter, we settled on a version of Captain Chumspike that was fierce, simple, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see at least a couple of times during your adventures in Entrath.\nWe\u2019re still experimenting with encounter conversations. We really like all the possibilities this tech opens up, and we\u2019ve even gone back and put some conversations into the most deserving encounters in Chapter I. Be on the lookout for those as well when Chapter II hits. We\u2019re really excited for how much these interactions improve the campaign and the new feelings that this feature can evoke. I, for one, cannot wait for Chapter II of the Chronicles of Entrath. See you on the sea!\nCorey Burkhart-", "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 23, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "text": "If you've played through as the mage before, you know that the mage is the most flexible of our original classes. While warriors run around bashing things and clerics aim to crush opponents under the weight of their ridiculous health totals, the mage has a range of options which can change drastically depending on your race. For me personally, that makes the mage the most replayable of all of the classes. However, that flexibility and replayability comes at the price of a much lower health total by comparison.\nHey gang! Ryan Sutherland, aka HexRysu, with you once again. I\u2019m here to bring you the last of our class previews for Chronicles of Entrath: Chapter II. In case you missed it, Jared covered the cleric\u2019s update here\n,  Phil covered our warrior update here\nand Dan covered the new ranger class here\n. However, for those of you more magically inclined, you\u2019ll find a force to be reckoned with in the new mage order I will reveal today.\nPart of working on the new chapter of our campaign has been spending some time reflecting on the decisions of the first chapter. After much discussion, we decided that the mage\u2019s starting health total of 14 (before race talents) is a tad too punishing. Therefore, we\u2019ve decided to move the mage\u2019s starting health total up to 17 from the beginning. In addition, there will be some more options to improve the survivability of the mage. Of course, there will still be a bunch of options for those of you who just want pure destructive power. Our mage is all about options.\nOne thing you\u2019ll notice is that the new mage talents makes your leveling choices really matter. Unlike the other classes, our mage talent tree forces you to choose one of two very different paths. The mage's second tier of talents is the most restrictive of all of talent trees, but in return you are granted awesome arcane power.\nLet\u2019s start with the more destructive half of the mage tree. First off, you\u2019ll have access to a brand new spell called Chaos Missile. While this spell is fairly innocuous looking as it just deals 1 damage for one SP, it\u2019s actually extremely useful for killing off any troops your opponents happen to drop early on. Sure, many times it\u2019s a coin flip, but because its SP cost starts so low, you\u2019ll be able to fire Chaos Missile off two or three times in a game and still have enough SP left over for other talents.\nBehind Chaos Missiles we have the first class card for mage to show off, Destructive Magic. This is an extremely powerful card, assuming you are able to keep it in your hand for a few turns. If you can manage to hold onto it, Destructive Magic has the power to completely swing the game in your favor, if not flat out win it.\nBoth SP Boon and Wizard\u2019s Cap give the player a few new ways to pick up some starting SP, which as most mages know is invaluable. Behind both of those talents we have one of my favorites, Eye of Chaos. Eye of Chaos is a slow card that can eventually just win you the game. With this card, every time you play something you get closer and closer to creating a new Chaostouched. This is truly the path that leads to madness. Just by naturally playing the game, you\u2019ll be slowly moving closer and closer to summoning tentacly terrors. In case you aren\u2019t familiar, a few of our Chaostouched friends like Shoggoth, Poet of Gla'aki and Bastardspawn of Bokrug can leave your opponent whimpering in terror. Of course, you do run the risk of creating a Chaos Gate and just outright destroying everything. What the chaos giveth, the chaos can taketh away.\nFinally, Alchemy adds a bit of extra damage to the mage\u2019s arsenal. You can pick up this talent to deal a bit more damage with a random card in your hand, or you can build your deck around it with some expensive cards and have a shot at just completely blowing your opponent up.\nOn the opposite side of the talent tree we have the makings of a much more defensive mage. This side of the tree is also quite a bit more straightforward at keeping you alive long enough to leverage your spells to win the game. Let\u2019s start off with the other new Learned Spell offered on this tier - Magic Barrier. Magic Barrier gives you a 0/4 wall with Flight. The Barrier acts as a stopgap for nullifying opposing attackers. It\u2019s probably as good a time as any to remind you that spells like Chaos Missiles and Magic Barrier can be used at Quick speed. This means you can wait to see what the dungeon\u2019s attacks are before committing your hard earned SP to creating a blocker.\nHiding behind Magic Barrier is Destruction Magic\u2019s kindly sister, Protective Magic. This card works very similarly to Destruction Magic, while also being its mirror. Instead of dealing a ton of damage to your opponent\u2019s face and decimating their board, you get to refill your hand and gain a bunch of health. While obviously Destructive Magic can just easily end the game, Protective Magic comes at a much lower cost. Plus, since you\u2019re investing in the defensive side of the tree, you\u2019re much more likely to survive long enough to cast much more powerful magics down the line.\nMoving up the tree (and past another free point of SP with SP Buff), we find the Guardian Golem. Guardian Golem is a 0/2 that starts in play during your games and gives you a little speed bump if that\u2019s what you need. It also has a One Shot ability to make any of your cards invisible for a turn. This can be great if you want to play defensively or protect that much needed combo piece. Just behind Guardian Golem is Golem Graft, which gives your little golem a brand new ability to exhaust for 1 health and 1 SP. If you\u2019re the kind of player who has wanted a way to get an endless source of SP, well, here\u2019s your chance!\nThe final talent on this side of the tree is Concentration. Concentration provides a very interesting style of play for those who are interested, and I think those of you who loved our lower health version of Mage may perk up at this point. This talent will reduce the cost of your charge power down to\n! However, it comes with a pretty big cost, since when you use your charge power, you\u2019ll become Vulnerable until the end of your next turn. This means you\u2019ll have far more Spell Power than any other build, but you had better know how to protect yourself. There's great risk and great reward for those who seek to control nearly infinite cosmic power. I\u2019m excited to see which of our players are up for this kind of challenge.\nLast, we have two final talents to go over which are in the middle of the tree. First off we have the Mage Gems, and these are nothing to scoff at. The Mage's Minor Orb of Thought grants the ability to add draw to any of your socketed troops when you play them out. This is a pretty insane deal for mages. Moon'airu Sensei is a card that has seen a lot of play in PvP tournaments, and this gem let's you put Sensei's power on practically anything. Not to mention how powerful this gem is on any double socketed troop. On the other side, the Mage's Major Orb of Spell Power grants the ability to make any of your troops into an SP generating machine. Look at how this card would work with something like Eldritch Dreamer. Generating 6 SP a turn is a pretty insane rate. As with all of our gems, there are countless combinations, but mages have some of the most powerful ones in the game if you build your deck wisely.\nThe final talent I have for you is Balance, and it's a bit of a hint towards the future. Balance massively upgrades both Destructive Magic and Protective Magic. With Balance, both cards now have their abilities upgrade every turn while they are in your deck. This means that when you eventually draw them you\u2019ll have a card much more powerful than any we\u2019d ever rightfully print in HEX. However, as the name implies, doing so requires you to balance the yin and the yang of becoming a mage.\nThe entire idea of a mage in Entrath is destructive and creative forces pulling at one another, and Balance shows the mage's inner struggle. With the release of Chapter II, it's currently very difficult to get both Protective and Destructive Magic and then find Balance. It is possible, but you\u2019ll have to give up everything else in the tree. Obviously, when our next installment comes out, it\u2019ll be much easier to get there... but that\u2019s for another day. Here\u2019s our mage tree so you can balance the books yourself:\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this tour of the mage\u2019s new Spells and abilities. We're very excited for all of the new builds possible in what was already our most versatile class. We hope you are too.

Also showed me that i still had the drivers for my gtx680 installed (using 970 now). It also easily lets you pick and choose what drivers to back up. And another great feature ive been using is the monitor, keeps track of processor and graphic card loads, and temperatures all on one nice screen. And what really convinced me to buy it, is its yours for life. Free updates, never have to buy a \"new\" version. And you can use it on any PC you install steam on! Try the free version from their website, then if you like it buy it on steam.\nTreexy responded and I believe you can download driver fusion (free version) from steam and then later upgrade if you want. Also, steam achievements for cleaning up your drivers!

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 24, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "text": "Growing up, I always gravitated toward the villain in movies: Darth Vader, Pinhead, The Kurgan, General Kael. The list goes on and on. In some ways I think we might be drawn toward things that embody traits we don\u2019t possess. If I were to put myself on the DnD alignment chart I\u2019d be lawful neutral, so maybe these baddies are my inner yearning to add some spice in my life. You might be wondering, what does any of this have to do with HEX? Well I\u2019ll tell you what, you can\u2019t have a great hero without a great villain. In Chapter II I wanted to make sure the Kraken was as formidable an opponent visually as he was mechanically. Your tale as the hero of Chapter II can only be as triumphant as the evil you must overcome, and the Kraken is one nasty fella'.\nYou might recognize this art from the early days of Entrath. As a creative on HEX, one of the hardest things to do is control your urge to throw all your favorite archetypes into the pot. The Kraken was an itch we just couldn\u2019t resist scratching, but it existed in isolation as a legendary card for a long time. With Chapter II, the Kraken is doing so much more as a dungeon boss. I felt like this was the perfect opportunity to reimagine the character and give it a uniquely Entrathian spin.\nFirst things first, we needed some ideation. Cory and I worked together on some of the high level objectives with the redesign. We knew we wanted something that looked large, dangerous and relatable. The first two on that list are fairly straight forward but the last one, relatable, is one of the trickier challenges. However, it is a very important part of character design. You are essentially looking to integrate enough design language so your audience can connect the dots between the new things they are looking at with things they know that embody the right traits.  It all sounds pretty intuitive and obvious when you lay it out on paper, but it has to be a conscious effort on the part of the concept artist to tap into the right nodes of our subconscious. While I was fairly certain about the more micro level details of the creature - dolphin and squid skin, tentacles, bio luminescent elements, etc. - I wasn\u2019t certain on the overall skeleton.  After working through some iterations, it became clear that giving the monster a few human-like skeletal traits helped elevate his presence and suggest an intelligence more befitting and frankly more frightening for such a large creature. With the sketch locked in, we were ready to begin work on the final artwork for the Kraken.\nWe enlisted one of the very talented artists on HEX, Chuy De Leon, to create the final artwork for the Kraken. You may recognize his work elsewhere in our game. He brought you most of the nodescapes, the tiny little environment paintings you see in the details panel as you adventure around the campaign. With his great eye for composition, values, colors and texture, I knew he was a great fit for this piece. We went back and forth a couple times getting all the details down.\nLast but not least, we can\u2019t forget about the dungeon map itself. The Kraken dungeon map artwork has been public for quite some time now and, while it remains mostly the same, I felt we had some work to do in order to get it looking its best for the new expansion. Some of these old maps from the early days of HEX were created with a slightly different sensibility than we have now. They were initially thought of as more of a static game board, but now we think of them more as a literal representation of your location in the world. For this reason, we removed the Kraken visual from the map, and I brought in a ton more detail overall to help immerse you more as you fight your way through Kraken\u2019s Cove. Here are some before and after images of the work done on the Kraken dungeon map.\nI\u2019m very excited to get all this new content into the hands of our dedicated HEX players. The campaign holds a very special place in my heart, and I\u2019m excited to see just how far we can take this experience. Until next time, keep on Hexing friends!\n-Tyler\nP.S.

It's a decent game that has a weak story, kind of weak character roster, some excessively long bits between save points...\nHowever, it's enjoyable.  Combat is fun, if you get familiar with it.  You can just mash x to win in the beginning, but a lot of fights (including mook encounters) will make that brain dead strategy hard to progress with.  I've beaten it once on PC now, and twice on 2 different difficulties on PS3.  It was an great deal of fun playing it again, so long after last touching it on my PS3.\nThis is the 4th game in the mainline Star Ocean game, but is a prequel.  You don't need to have played the previous games to understand what is going on, but it can help with references to previous games as well as staples of the series as a whole.\nPerformance wise - it's a pretty damn good port.  I'm running on slightly below spec hardware and getting really good framerates.  It doesn't have a litany of options to modify performance and display settings, but even on the lowest detail the game still looks decent enough as to not be distracting.\nControl-wise,, you'll probably want to use a controller versus keyboard and mouse.  The camera is a little dumb at times, overworld and in combat, and there is no pause during cutscenes (unless I an somehow mistaken, since I could not find a way to do so).\nI played this on PS3 when it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is basically that version with better textures (dual audio is a nice thing to have, sometimes).  Really, the enjoyable bits in terms of challenge aren't unlocked until after you beat the game the first time.  A series of dungeons are available after that, as well as the ability to replay the game at a higher difficulty.  While I'm not entirely the biggest fan of rebuilding my party from scratch to play anew at a new difficulty, having the option is a good thing.\nCrafting is great, though for some progression may be slow.  You need specific characters to join before you can craft certain types of items.  You don't get the most useful, Synthesis, until pretty much the end of the game.  Once that unlocks, it makes the game significantly easier if you know what you are doing with that skill.\nMany have reported issues launching this game (ASKA error).  I didn't have this problem until I tried to install a new USB device.  Once I unplugged it and rebooted, the game ran fine for me.  Keep that in mind that some people can't even run the game after buying it.  Hopefully these problems get fixed by SE in due time.\nHopefully this rambling is somehow informative.  Don't go in to this game expecting a masterpiece; that's not what this game is.  Like most Star Ocean games, it's a flawed experience propped up by a good combat system and some interesting character moments and a not too great story.

I own the original on the PS3 and have played it way more than any sane person should ever. I don't care about port quality; for my purposes it is ok and it functions as it should. If you want to read someone \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about mouse support or why their ridiculous 96kHz audio setup is not supported, that is someone else. My chief-complaint in regards to porting is the lack of Playstation-type button prompts.\n\nLet me get this out of the way first: Improved graphics are nice. I get the impression that they desaturated the game a bit, which is a good thing, but, by far, the most impressive feature of this version of the game are the load times, which have been VASTLY improved, to the point of being basically non-existent. I'm sure they are there somewhere, but I have yet to actually notice a single loading screen.\nIt controls A LOT better than the PS3 version as well. It's still super clunky and awkward, but definitely better.\nAnd that's about all I can say for it. The story still sucks, the characters are still horrible, the art design in this thing is absolutely atrocious, both character and environment... What isn't overdone to hell and back is just as bland as the blandest thing there could possibly ever be. Gameplay is still interesting, but when stretched over 200+ hours of play time, there is no chance of it not being incredibly annoying. I like the fact that the character I choose to control actually affects how I play the game; tactics and such. You can overlevel and button mash it, but there is at least a genuine attempt at depth. Gameplay wise, it is an interesting game with nice ideas, but there is just SO MUCH working against it.\nYou can clear the game in about 50-80 hours. For reference, speed running it takes around 3 hours. Getting all the achievements is a 400 hours investment. Minimum. So if you are keen to your 100%'s, either come prepared or skip this one.\nThis is a game you can play and kind of enjoy. There is some good stuff to laugh at and there are some genuine moments of thrill and brilliance in the battle system. The bosses feel a bit cheap at times but mostly it works well enough and provide decent challenge.\nI feel like I should mention that Star Ocean requires a rather high tolerance for anime tropes; anime tropes done poorly and rather straight-faced, by the way. In the end, I do think that there is A LOT to really, passionately HATE about this game. But for some bizarre and inexplicable reason, I keep coming back to it. Everything in my heart says that I should never ever recommend this game, but I do think it's worth a shot, specially if you come in with an open mind about how much of a sh*tfest it is actually going to be. Sometimes you just have to take the bad with the good...

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 25, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "text": "Through the first chapter of the campaign, the cleric was very well suited to handle many of the diverse challenges found within the Howling Plains and its various dungeons. Without having to worry about the limited starting hand-size of the warrior or the precariously low health of the mage, the cleric was a good all-around class choice for many players. Praying for victory takes on a whole new meaning when your deck takes advantage of the plentiful health gain and artifact-centric talents the cleric has available. Smiting your enemies becomes a matter-of-course for the well prepared!\nHey, friends! It\u2019s Jared Saramago from the HEX R&D team. I\u2019m here today to preview the new tier of cleric talents coming with the launch of Chapter II of the campaign, The Alachian Sea.\nThe challenges of The Alachian Sea will shake even the deepest faith. Let\u2019s take a look at how your cleric will stand resolute with a new tier of talents.\nLet\u2019s start by examining the new talents that are focused on creating or interacting with Blessings. Blessed Birth will let you start the game with four Blessings already in your deck. That\u2019s the equivalent of having already activated your charge power, Pray, twice before you\u2019ve even taken a turn. This effect gets doubled if you have 100 or more cards in your deck. Getting a head start on Blessing creation means you\u2019ll likely gain health earlier and more often than before! If you\u2019ve been thinking about playing a 100 card deck, you might also be interested in the Stout talent. You\u2019ll gain a bonus talent point to spend for cards you were already adding to your deck anyways.\nAfter unlocking Blessed Birth, you can take an adjacent talent that compliments it rather nicely: Child of the Right Hand. This talent lets you draw an extra card for any of the Blessings that end up in your starting hand. This combo can make for some really explosive starts, especially when combined with cards that care about playing cheap actions, like Hatchery Malvoker, Embertongue Skarn, and Psychic Ascension. It also has some impressive synergy with cards that want you to put even more cards in your hand, like Forbidden Tomeseeker; Puck, Dream Bringer; and Bowie Starlight.\nYou can also combine these talents with Discipline of the Mind, which allows you to conjure a Blessing from your deck, once per game, on demand. Use it to find that desperate heal you need in a tight damage race, create an immediate buff for your Righteous Paladin, or add the final counter to transform your Incantation of Ascendance or Incantation of Righteousness. This talent also has the potential to search up the impressive coyotle Zodiac Blessings, making it a great choice for a coyotle cleric.\nUntil now, clerics have increased their survivability almost exclusively by raising their health. Now, there are some new tools to endure enemy attacks that are less about laying on hands and more about keeping your opponent\u2019s hands off. One of those abilities is Armed Against the Darkness. Beginning the game with 1 point of armor may not seem like a big deal at first, but just ask anyone who\u2019s played a dwarf or necrotic cleric how helpful it can be. There are a number of enemies in the campaign that need to deal damage to be effective (hello Mr. Killipede!), and that armor can really shut them down. Doubling up on your armor bonus is sure to be a favorite talent choice for the necrotic and dwarven clerics out there.\nAnother staple defensive tool for clerics is the talent Cleanse. Once per game, you have the ability to wipe away most negative status effects (like burning and dazed) and recover some health in the process. This is the sort of amazing utility power that will keep clerics churning through those dungeons with debilitating ailments. Where the other classes will start to struggle and stumble, the cleric can use their Cleanse skill to just shrug it off and keep going.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the continuation of talents that use both artifacts and troop buffs to secure victory. First, we have an extension of the talent path that upgrades Monument of Faith in Loyal to our Leader. Another troop-friendly talent is the Altar of Might, which creates a Shrine of Briggadon. These effects are obviously useful in your more straight-forward troop decks, but they also provide extra power to decks using cards like Electroid, Rocket Ranger, and the cleric\u2019s own Soul Vessel, which are dependent on having artifacts in play. Last but not least, there\u2019s The Chosen One. Making the right troop Invincible can help protect a vulnerable combo piece or win condition. It also lets you stave off an opponent\u2019s attacks with an impervious blocker.\nSpeaking of combo pieces, let\u2019s take a look at a pair of talents that are interesting from a deck building perspective. Premonitions gives you an effect similar to a free Arcane Focus or Peek at the start of the game. This kind of consistency is always welcome in HEX, especially if you are trying to find specific cards to pair with the ones in your hand. Diligent Study makes finding additional copies of a card more likely. Besides the obvious synergy with Blessings, this effect has all kinds of other potential that\u2019s just waiting to be discovered. For example, it pairs well with Escalation cards, like Crash of Beasts, improves the odds of chaining together multiple Pack Raptors or Sliver of the Immortal Spear, and might even cause some shenanigans with cards like Replicator's Gambit and Syzygy.\nIf that sort of deck building craziness interests you, you may also want to consider Holy Hands. Having two extra copies of your cards equipped with gloves will not only make drawing those cards more consistent, but it also lets you navigate around the Shard Alignment restrictions on deck building. Want to play more copies of Angel of Glory but you\u2019re limited to a single Diamond legendary? Well, just equip it with Glorified Gloves and Holy Hands will do the rest!\nBefore we wrap up our preview, it would be silly not to talk about the new cleric-only class gems. The Cleric Class Gems talent will give you access to the Minor Gem of Aegis and the Major Gem of Prayer. I can imagine the Minor Gem being used with double-socket cards like Cockatwice and Royal Diplomat, but I\u2019m most interested in seeing what sorts of combinations you all come up with. Aegis makes it that much harder for your opponent to get rid of your critical combo piece or bomb. As for the Major Gem, I imagine both Mad Robomancer and Cosmic Shaman as strong socketing candidates. What do you think? If you\u2019ve got some interesting socketing ideas for these new gems, share them with us in the forums.\nThat\u2019s about it for the new cleric talents. Our goal in designing these new powers was to build upon the strength and diversity of the talents in the first tier, while also empowering new strategies and synergies that further develop what it means to play a cleric in our campaign. I think you\u2019ll find that tier two has a lot to offer as you make your way toward the new level cap. Here is the full tree so you can plan out your favorite paths yourself:\nComment below to share your thoughts, and let us know if you\u2019ll be playing a cleric when Chapter II arrives. Stay tuned for more previews coming soon. Until then, may all your top-decks be blessed!\n- Jared Saramago", "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "410380", "page": 25, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "text": "Hello and welcome back to another Chapter II primer. You may have heard some articles tossing around the term \u201cAlachian Sea\u201d when talking about our new content.\nWell, hoist your sails and turn hard to port, today we will be talking about the region that give this zone its name - the Alachian sea! But, this watery realm is so much more than just a namesake. In Chapter II you'll be able to set sail upon the high seas in a nautically themed adventure, complete with a (sturdy?) vessel, a whole new set of talents, and plenty of booty to carry home. Can you grab everything you need before your luck runs out? Let's break out the spyglass and see what\u2019s on the horizon!\nFirst up let\u2019s talk about your boat. While sailing the seas, you will have a boat that will replace your champion\u2019s charge power, talents, and deck with its own. You will be able to customize your boat before every expedition on the Alachian Sea, including building a deck that is saved to the harbor and thus separate from your campaign deck. You will also select your talents, though at first you will be limited in your options. As you get your sea legs under you, however, you will unlock the abilities necessary to brave the deepest waters and furthest shores on Entrath.\nUnlike when playing with your champion, when captaining your boat you will have a hull instead of health. Hull will persist across encounters, so if you end an encounter at 17 hull, you will have 17 at the start of the next encounter. Cards that gain health, pay health, or lose health will not interact with your hull. If your hull is reduced to zero, don't worry, you'll be sent back to port for repairs and you can be back on the seas in no time.\nWhat this does is create a unique \u201cpress your luck\u201d style experience where every choice matters on the open sea. Do you sacrifice a troop you might need later to preserve your hull for the future? Or do you go in cannon\u2019s blazing and trust in Kismet to carry you to your destination?\nNow that we know how hull works, let's see what the boat talents are. The boat talents work much in the same way as your class talent tree except they only build vertically in a column. When you receive your boat, you will have three boat talents points to apply as you choose, though more can be found while sailing the Alachian Sea. It will be up to you to choose the talents that best support your playstyle and your deck.\nThere are four different trees that each represent a part of your boat - Mast, Crew, Cannons, and Hull.\nCaptain's Parrot: You begin the game with a\nin play.\nAye, Captain: It's Just You \"I'm on a Boat!\"\nFirst Mate: You begin the game with a random uncommon troop with cost [(2)] from your deck in play.\nQuarter Master: At the start of the game, put a random rare troop with cost [(1)] from your deck into play.\nBasic Hull: Your Base Hull is 40. The Hull of your ship persists across encounters.\nArmored Siding: You have\n.\nHeavy Hull: Your Base Hull is 60. you can't have dazed counters added to you.\nRepair Crew: After winning an encounter on the high seas, you recover 5 Hull.\nTattered Banner: [BASIC]: [5] --> Draw two cards. Drawn non-resouce cards get cost +[(2)].\nCrow's Nest: Troops you control have <b>Skyguard</b>.\nDragon Masthead: Your Tattered Banner talent instead has \"[BASIC]: [5] --> Draw two cards. Drawn non-resouce cards get cost -[(2)].\"\nEnchant Masthead: Your Dragon Masthead talent instead has \"[BASIC]: [5] --> Draw two cards. Drawn non-resouce cards get cost -[(2)]. Drawn resouce cards get \"Draw a card.\"\"\nCannons: You have \"[BASIC], Cooldown 3: [0] --> Deal 2 damage to a random opposing champion or troop.\"\nNewest Model Cannon: You get the newest model of cannon!\nMaster Gunner: Your cannons now target opposing champions or troops of your choice.\nPremium Super Cannon: You get a Premium Super Cannon \"[BASIC], Cooldown 2: [(3)] --> Deal 5 damage to target opposing champion or troop.\"\nThe Mast provides upgrades to your charge power while your Crew provides guaranteed troops for when the waters get rough. Cannons are somewhat unique in that they offer cheap, consistent abilities that are limited by cooldown. After you fire a cannon, you will need to reload as indicated by the text \"Cooldown X.\" At the start of each of your turns, one cooldown counter is removed from your cannon. Once there are no more counters, it can be bombs away once again! Finally, as mentioned earlier, Hull keeps you afloat. Talents in this tree will let you venture further and further afield without needing to stop for repairs.\nAs you progress through the Alachian Sea, you will uncover additional boat talent boats to further improve your vessel. Each of these trees will help against different challenges you encounter across the sea. Figure out which talents will help the most against different types encounters and soon you will own the water.\nBoat talents will be replacing your class talents while you are sailing. The only remaining piece of your character is that you will still have the same Shard Alignment rules for deck building. Since many classes have talents that grant cards and promote synergies for you to build around, we suggest that you try putting together a new deck before sailing out.\nAlachian Sea encounters were set up for players to have a more open experience. Most nodes on the water have 2-4 different paths that they are connected to, so you have a great deal of flexibility when shoving off from shore. We tried out some different variations on how the nodes would interact after your hull was depleted, and after some extensive testing we arrived at a system of soft save points. Sea captains in a hurry have the option of bypassing encounters they have already defeated. This will allow even the most land-lubbary amongst you to continue on your main story quest. However, for those of you with salt-water in your veins, traveling across the Alachian Sea in one trip will yield sunken treasures! You will receive bonus rewards for each encounter you best in a single run. Can you push your luck and conquer every corner of these seas? We can't wait to find out.\nThanks for stopping by and checking out what is in store for you in the Alacian Sea. I personally am super excited to see players get into this and interact with Chapter II. I hope that you are too. Unfurl the mizzen mast, it's not too far off before you'll be setting sail!\nDan Clark-", "early_access": false}

As before, highly ranked players will receive a small boost in their initial ladder ranking so that all players can enjoy a smooth climbing experience.\nSecond, players will continue to be able to earn gold, packs, and Alternate Arts by climbing the Limited and Constructed ladders. This season, we have the following Alternate Arts up for grabs:\nThose who reach Cosmic will also receive a season exclusive animated sleeve! You voted on it, so we are extremely excited to reveal our animated Alternate Art Cottontail Explorer sleeves.\nThird, we updated the Terms and Conditions for the Cosmic Crown Showdown tournament, to ensure a consistently great experience for the competitors.

We have a couple of nice things for you today, including a sneak peak at our Season 3 sleeves, a fun HEX quiz, the first part of our AskHEX answers, and more!\nWe are offering \u201cAdventure Pack 1\u201d for sale in the in-game store\n. These packs are purchasable for gold and grant 2x common cards, 2x pieces of equipment or Stardust, and 1x campaign card.\nPurchasing Adventure Pack 1 from the store also carries a chance at one of the racial exclusive rares normally reserved for running the first part of the campaign. We want you playing your favorite race and class combination whenever you dive into Entrath.\nSeason 2 will be ending November 1, 2016! This is your last chance to get Season 2 AAs, sleeves, and to secure your place in this season's Cosmic Crown Showdown\n.\n>\nIf you would like a sneak peak at Season 3's sleeves, visit our Season 3 announcement here\n.\nOur Haunted Harvest\ncelebration is in full swing this week. Make sure you play some campaign to get your hands on some copies of Stingy Jack before he gets his claws on you... not to mention some of the other fine treats we have to offer this Harvest season:\nStop by our Haunted Harvest\nannouncement for full details on where to grab all the goodies this year.\nSpeaking of tricky treats, we have a HEX trivia game that you can play to win some extra packs. Here's how it works:\nClick here\nto visit the quiz page. You will need to sign into the quiz using your in-game name and your email address of choice so we can contact you if you win. You will get 20 questions of varying difficulty (easy, normal, hard). You will have 15 seconds to answer each question, so time is of the essence. Pick the right answer and you can choose whether you want to get a harder question or try another at your current difficulty. Pick the wrong answer and you'll automatically get assigned an easier one.\nSpeed & difficulty decide your score:\n\nWe will reward the top 20 contestants with booster packs. The amount of packs will be determined by the number of unique contestants, so the more the merrier! Please note that each person is limited to 1 competitive entry. Your account is only eligible for prizes based on your first recorded score. Additionally, there is a small block system that works to prevent multiple entries. Please enjoy this quiz within the boundaries of the rules.\nFinally, this quiz will run from October 21st to October 28th. You have one week to study up and get your Entrathian edification on. Show everyone you're in the know when it comes to HEX!\nAnd while we are on the theme of answering questions, you may recall we introduced a new series\na while back. Our take on an AMA, AskHEX was an opportunity for you guys to delve a little deeper into the minds behind this game. I am pleased to announce that we are going to start answering some of those questions now. This will be a multi-part series since there were just too many good questions to try and get through in one sitting. Make sure to stay tuned for more AskHEX answers in the weeks to come!\nA: It\u2019s great! Other than working with a bunch of nerds\u2026.\nSeriously though, as with any other job, we have deadlines, meetings and have a lot to get done. I\u2019ve certainly lost sleep for this game, worked weekends, and have a few more gray hairs than I did two years ago. I think that\u2019s true of everyone here. For example, I just watched one of our designers freak out for two days on what to rename a single button.\nBut, for however stressed I get, I can step back and look at what I work on and it makes me so happy. This is my dream job, and there\u2019s a reason I lose sleep and work weekends for this game. I love my job, this game, this company, and this community.\nTLDR: It\u2019s a job. It\u2019s the BEST job, but it\u2019s a job. \u2013Ryan Sutherland\nA: Evo Gauntlet was much better received than I could have imagined when designing the format. It was something I spent a fair amount of time on, interacting with different members of production and R&D to get feedback, and I\u2019m so pleased with the reception from players.\nAs for the future, we\u2019re always working on new things. We\u2019re hoping to get out another fun project that I personally have been working on for years. It took some convincing of some people that this was the best way to implement the system, but I\u2019m really excited that they\u2019re on board now. I\u2019m hopeful that this will go out soon, and I really hope that players will love it as much as they have Evo Gauntlet. \u2013Corey Burkhart\nA: Yes and no. We still plan on releasing 2 pieces for most cards (I\u2019ll get into that in a moment), but there are only so many we can release with each batch of content. We will try to continue pushing these out the door. AZs will always have equipment for cards from older sets as we try to fill in those gaps. For the most part, I try to go through and look for what still doesn\u2019t have equipment. Cards that see a lot of play or are fan favorites are good targets for filling out equipment.\nIn regards to the \u201cno\u201d portion of my answer, the design philosophy on equipment has changed since what was originally announced during the Kickstarter. Common cards will typically only have one piece of equipment and some uncommons will only have a single piece as well. Set bonuses also haven\u2019t been looked at in a while. It is still something that we like, it just requires some design work and is a great deal less important than our other priorities at the moment. \u2013Dan Clark\nA: Spam and more spam. \u2013Dan Clark\nA: I imagine one day we will see most, if not all, of our older powers return. It depends on how popular and deep the mechanic is.\nTo rate the specific powers you listed, I think Escalation has the highest likelihood to return since we only saw five cards with the mechanic and it was well received. However just as before, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll ever see Escalation in high volumes in a set.\nInspire was mined pretty deeply the first time around, so I\u2019d be surprised if we see it back too soon. (Most Diamond, Ruby and Sapphire keywords were used already.) I also think it\u2019s a mechanic that needs a certain density so you feel like you\u2019re living the Inspire dream of curving several Inspire troops in a row.\nEmpower is a surprisingly difficult mechanic to find a bunch of interesting numbers, but I\u2019d be happy to bring it back at some point in the future, probably at smaller amounts though.\nProphecy will certainly be back. It\u2019s one of my personal favorite abilities from HEX and does randomness in a very fun way. One thing to note is that the next time we see Prophecy it may show up under a different guise. The idea of keying off of the next X in your deck has a lot of play and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s more than one mechanic living inside of the Prophecy shell.\nTLDR: Yep, we\u2019ll certainly see keywords return once we\u2019ve spread our wings for a bit longer. Each mechanic dictates how much of the set needs to be dedicated to the mechanic. \u2013Ryan Sutherland\nA: Favorite was [card]Lady Shimmer[/card] for sure. I love unbounded effects, and getting 6 or 7 of her to march out is epic. I think my least favorite was [champ]Zared Venomscorn[/champ], of all things. I like limited a lot, and I felt like he made a lot of builds impossible when mixed with that cardpool (there were a lot of interesting X/1's in Shards and Destiny.). \u2013Chris Woods\nA: All requests should be sent to your friendly, neighborhood Dinotropia.

You see, the veil is closer on this night of nights and the spirits of the dead roam freely. Some believe that the only way to stay safe is to make a maze of your words, to trap the spirits until the sun rises again and they can be laid to rest once more.\nSo coyotle and shin\u2019hare pups shiver, only in part from the cold, as they swap stories of the deep and dark. One of the tales they tell is that of Stingy Jack.\nSome say he is a harvest spirit driven mad by the unholy energies of zombies as they tromped through a pumpkin patch. Others say he is the result of the primal of greed, Marbaras, whose sickly energies pooled too heavy on the land.\nHis origins a mystery, his arrival is oft heralded by thin voices raising in chorus as children all across Entrath chant these words:\nDuring the haunted nights in Entrath, you will receive the treat of the Stingy Jack Sleeve, just for being brave enough to roam the streets in the dark. (Simply log in and you will automatically receive the sleeve!)\nAs the other half of the saying goes, a well-played trick deserves its own rewards. Show off your plays \u2013 and tricks \u2013 and you can earn the Dread Harvest AA card. (This means you have to play tournaments!)\nPlaying in dungeons across Entrath can reward players with the Stingy Jack card and its equipment pieces, the Scarecrow\u2019s Scythe and the Corn Huskers. In the harvest season, a time of plenty, Stingy Jack wants everything. He wields his terrifying scythe and grabs hold of this treat or that with his ever-sticky gloves. Hide your harvest well, for ol\u2019 Jack is a-coming to trick-or-treat.\nTo earn these rewards, champions must defeat any dungeon during the Haunted Harvest holiday:\n\nSo how do you get the rewards?\nThe first time a player logs in during this holiday, they will receive the Stingy Jack sleeve.\nAll tournaments will have a participation prize of an AA Dread Harvest card. Basically, enter a tournament, get the card.\nPlayers that win a constructed ranked ladder match will have a 25% chance of earning an AA Dread Harvest card.\nPlayers can earn PvE items by playing in the Campaign dungeons. There is one card and two equipment items to earn. By defeating any dungeon you will earn one of the three items at random. Each of them has a percent chance to drop: 15% on the Rare Equipment, 25% on the Uncommon Equipment, and 60% on the Card.\nJoin the spooky-scary campfire between October 18 at 19:00 CET (10 AM PST) and November 1 at 18:59 CET (9:59am PST) to gather your harvest.

I was a chapter 4 when it happen.So you might need to play in one sitting.\nSecondly,Theres no exit option for the game. When I press Esc and press 'Menu',it goes back to the title screen, and I cant find any options to leave the game so I have to manually go to my desktop using alt+tab and quit the game from there.\nThirdly, the 'subtitles' are either not in sync with the voice or the voice said something that is not in the subtiles so I was confused.The speed of the subtitles coming in was super fast and I haven't have the time to read and the (robotic?) voice is not helping.

Coming in as a new sim racer, here are some of the pros and cons in my perspective.\nPROS:\n- Force Feedback: As a new sim racer, the force feedback feels great on a wheel!\n- Graphics: This game look beautiful, probably one of the best looking sim racers out there.\n- Sounds: The cars sound amazing, you can really feel the sheer power of the car just based on the sound alone.\n- Ranking System: It isn't perfect, but it works. You can definitely tell which players have more experience based on their ranks and how they do in races.\n- Multiplayer: You can for sure find good and genuine races which can really pump your adrenaline when fighting for positions. But there are flaws (see cons).\nCONS:\n- Multiplayer: There are going to be people who will intentionally ram you or swerve left and right on the track trying to \"defend\" their position... Also, there will be races where you will probably get caught in a carnage on lap 1. Especially on turn 1. Some players just don't know the breaking points and may just run into you on a turn.\n- Bugs: Sometimes races don't start properply and you may be stuck on the wait screen or the start-line of a race. (usually happens in larger games).\n- Freezes: I do occasionally get freezes in this game. But it doesn't happen too often to annoy me.\nOverall:\nI love this game. The game just feels so good, looks great, and sounds great! Yes, there are cons in multiplayer, but I'm not saying there will be carnage in every single race. You will have races that can be really fun and competitive!\nTo me, it feel as if the skill set in this player base has a wider range than other sim racers how there. If you want a sim racing game with a more serious player base, maybe check out iRacing or Race Room (That's my opinion, definitely do your research.).\nWhether you are new to sim racing or not, I say give this game a try!\nBut again, if you want something more serious, maybe check out other titles.", "hours": 179.1, "username": "\u25e2\u25e4 kLA", "products": 93, "early_access": false}

The game is still in alpha, and plays like one.\nThis wont be a full review, because it cant be. The game is still in alpha, so with the very frequent updates adding and fixing things, which is good, things are going to change.\nThe game overall at the moment should not be played competitively. The mechanics aren't smooth, the combat is sometimes unresponsive and the gamemode is flawed and overly basic - AT THE CURRENT STATE. What this game is now, is the foundations for a GREAT game, the combat although fidly at the moment, will feel very satifying when it is developed some more. The building aspect of the game, though minimal now, is still enough for it to impact the game greatly and is the base for a very easy to use building system comparable to the one in Fortnite.\nThe physics and destruction isn't the best, but works. With development, it will create some cool and tactical battles while playing.\nThe weapons are fairly balanced but can feel unresponsive and hard to hit shots with certain weapons in certain situations, for example bot action rifles, however with some tweaking to hit registry and movement this can feel a lot nicer. Grenades dont feel too useful except in buildings, which from experience combat barely happens in single buildings. This can be fixed by making them go a little further when thrown.\nThe crafting and gathering is a good idea, but basic. This allows it to not get in the way and I think it should stay this way. Soem things are harder to craft and gather than others, but not overly difficult to the point where you dont see action. Still, I'm sure later people will be more serious and assign squads to do this job for the team.\nThere is currently a single gamemode, with more to definately come because the current is probably the weakest point of the game. The overall objective of the game is to destory the enemy base, and thats it. Obviously this will be tweaked, as it is just the early playable test version, but more smaller sub-objectives need to be added sooner rather than later.\nOverall, I definately recommend giving this game a try even if its just for the one time. I'd also say to come back in a few weeks to a month as I think by then the game will be much better, as its still in its very early stages. This is fine and all you can do is give it time to mature as with some more time the game will be very good. Cheers", "hours": 4.9, "username": "Tyyler", "products": 84, "early_access": true}

Since my PS3 is broken beyond repair, I'm using this chance to finally lay this game to rest. Unfortunately for me, this game proves that I'm no longer a teenager.\nSTAR OCEAN\u2122 - THE LAST HOPE is a JRPG through and through. It tries to be taken seriously but failed spectacularly in the first 10 minutes. The game has the most stereotypical anime plot ever, that anyone who frequently watched animes and read mangas knows will happen next. It literally uses all tropes and cliches that each and every other animes used. The characters are even worst as none of them are remotely interesting or unique. All of them are copy and pasted from any other Japanese media for teenagers ever existed.\nJust like any other low effort JRPG, the game is padded with mindless grind where players either need to fight certain amount of enemies to 100% the database or to farm crafting material. It gets old, real fast as crafting is essential in every Star Ocean game. Not doing it means players are basically missing out half of the game.\nBattles are okay, in the first hour at least. Thanks to the grind, fighting enemies became more like a chore than fun and like in the previous Star Ocean games, the bonus board makes a return. These bonuses are crucial to the game's level progression, so players are incentivize to get them as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the bonus board resets every time players exits the game so this further forces players to keep playing as they're grinding. Coincidentally, the bonus board always seems to break easier while fighting the boss for some reason...\nIf the story and characters are bad, then the voice acting are even more atrocious. The English VO is so jarring and cringe worthy but I really don't want to blame the VAs as they were given bad scripts in the first place.\nIf you like animes/mangas, then you'll probably enjoy this game more than I ever will. If you expect quality from this, look elsewhere. Unless this game is on a 75% sale, I will never recommend this game to anyone above 25 years old.", "hours": 34.1, "user_id": "76561198058043953", "username": "kandnm115709", "products": 101, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

Com uma mobilidade incr\u00edvel e especialidade de ataques em \u00e1rea, o Musah se destaca em PvP de pequena escala, mas suas defesas baixas o tornam um pouco mais complicado de ser dominado em PvP de grande escala. O Musah atinge seu auge enquanto avan\u00e7a atravessando o campo de batalha para desferir poderosos ataques em \u00e1rea em seus inimigos, mas cada movimento n\u00e3o calculado pode ser fatal devido \u00e0s suas baixas defesas.\nO territ\u00f3rio de Val\u00eancia traz novos conte\u00fados, conhecimentos, NPCs, monstros e miss\u00f5es.

Here's all you need to know about the update:\nThere are two separate Ladders, one for Limited format tournaments - that is Draft, Sealed and Evolution Sealed - and one for games in the Constructed format.\nThe Limited format has its name because you have to build your deck from a\nnumber of cards. Here's how:\nIn a\n, you and your opponents bring 3 booster packs to the table and open them together, passing the packs around,\none card each until the packs are empty.\nThe Sealed format works slightly different. In the classic\nformat, you enter with 6 booster packs and open them all to construct your deck from those cards. In\n, you bring 2 booster packs yourself and the game provides you with 3 more packs of\nand\ncards to build your deck. You can earn more packs as you win games, with one win granting you 1 additional pack to round out your deck and your third win granting you one more for the final touches.\nPlayers will have two separate ranks for those two modes.\nAbove is an example of how it will look in-game. The player here has achieved a Gold ranking in the Limited format and the highest ranking - Cosmic - in the Constructed format.\nPlaying any Limited format tournament will affect your rank in that ladder, playing in a ranked Constructed match will affect your rank there. Both formats are exclusive and do not count towards the other's rank. The ranks go from Bronze all the way to Platinum and the elite division of Cosmic, with five tiers to each of the five divisions:\nYou advance through the ranks by playing matches. Win a match and earn a star, lose a match and you lose a star. Go on a winning streak and you will earn an additional star for winning!\nThe system will always attempt to match you with players of the same or similar skill level and widen its search to avoid wait times. Here's a special bit: once you graduate from the beginner's division, Bronze, you cannot go back down for the remainder of that Season.\nSeasons last 2 months and are played back to back with no offseason.\nWith that said...\nWhat's in it for you? Well, besides the obvious bragging rights, there is epic loot waiting to be had as you climb the ladder.\nDuring any ongoing Season, you will be able to show your current rank with a Sleeve for your decks. After a Season has concluded, you will be granted a Sleeve reflecting your\nin that Season. Here's how they look for Season 1:\nTo furhter impress your opponents and show off your aptitude, your cards will rest on a special plinth during your matches. These plinths reflect your current rank, just like the regular Season Sleeves. Check them out:\nHEX wouldn't be HEX without a few new Alternate Art (AA) cards. Advancing through the ranks in both Limited and Constructed play will reward you with these cool new interpretations of classic cards:\nAs if all that's not already loot a-plenty, you will also earn Gold - our in-game currency - and booster packs as you move up the ladder.\nThat's it everyone, the full scoop on the ladder! Do you have what it takes to reach Cosmic? Show us!\nGet your competitive juices flowing and hit the ladder in\n.\nYour HEX Team.", "early_access": false}

But this game do has opportunities. If the physics get optimized and you have a room scale setup this could really be an awesome competitive game on vr. And multiplayer is on the horizon. The developer seems to be really responsive and uses the tips of the community. If you`re a squash fan you can buy this to support the developer. I`m pretty sure more updates will follow.\nSummary:\n+Good basis\n+opportunity to become a competitive vr game\n+responsive dev\n+multiplayer coming\n+would bash my table again\n-design is a bit dull atm\n-responsiveness/physics not yet on point\nGet this game if you want to support the developer optimizing this game, he takes note of your comments", "hours": 1.1, "username": "ABU", "products": 84, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "410380", "page": 33, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "text": "Hey guys, Corey Burkhart here to talk about an upcoming feature for the game \u2013 Ladder. I want to give you an overview of the goals, follow it up by design thoughts and then talk you through the feature\nThe goal for the ladder is two-fold. We want to give players a way to play against others in a fair environment. We also wanted to make the system simple in presentation and easy to explain to newer players. In addition to the above two goals, we wanted to reward players for participating in limited tournaments by naturally doing what they are doing in the game: play in drafts and sealed gauntlets. This is a somewhat secondary goal to the above two.\nThere are a couple of systems that lead to a ladder experience. The first one I want to talk about is the Star Craft II and the League of Legends ladder. In a most basic sense, these use a Match Making Rating and the outcome of matches to determine your rank on the ladder. They are somewhat complex in how they function and intentionally don\u2019t make their internal mechanics well known. This is primarily done to limit system exploitations as being at the top of those ladders has some significant ramifications. The other option for a ladder is a simpler approach like the Hearthstone ladder. This type of ladder focuses on simplifying the experience for the players and make it very easy to explain to new players for how to interact with the ladder. Hearthstone\u2019s ladder gives you stars for winning and takes stars away for losing.\nDuring the design of the system we wanted to check a few assumptions. First we narrowed down our choice between a black-box MMR ladder and an open design. Then, we wanted to set up some checks to ensure that more experienced players are not ruining the fun for less experienced players. With the design we also wanted to make sure that players felt a sense of progression and that players were rewarded for engaging with the systems. Finally we wanted to ensure that if spectators via a live stream observed a ranked match, they could contextually understand the rank of the two players. Finally we wanted to make sure that high skilled players moved up in ranks as quickly as possible to avoid the feel-bad moments of newer players getting outclassed both in skill and in collection size.\nAfter we narrowed down the design and made a few assumptions, we decided to test some of them. We took 6 months worth of past tournament activities for limited tournaments and applied our limited ladder model to them. We wanted to see how many people make it to Cosmic and what sort of spread of players we end up having. Of course, this test was somewhat distorted because players playing in tournaments were incentivized to only play in the tournaments by rewards they received. There were no meta-rewards to keep playing. However, even with the lack of rewards we found that players play a surprisingly large amount of limited tournaments, so it was reasonable to expect quite a few high ranked players.\nFor constructed, we didn\u2019t quite have the right data in the game, so we built a model. We took a large number of players and randomly assigned them a skill value between zero and one. We then also used similar assumptions to assign players an activity rating. We then had these fake players play against each other for the whole ladder season. We checked the results to ensure that players with high skill level ended up at the top of the ladder with a bias towards those who participated more based on their activity rating.\nOnce we were satisfied with the test results we went on to implementation.\nWe settled on the following implementations. There are two ladders in the game: one for constructed play and one for limited play. They function similar with the following two exceptions: in limited ladder, you can not drop down in divisions and in limited ladder due to the nature of participation, you do not get paired against similarly ranked opponents.\nThe ladder consists of 5 divisions: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Cosmic. Each division except for Cosmic is split into 5 tiers (V through I). Your division and tier is your rank (i.e. Silver III).\nPlayers progress through ranks by playing matches. Each match win results in a star and each match loss results in a loss of a star. Win streaks are rewarded with additional stars to accelerate players to their \u201ccorrect\u201d rank. You receive an extra star for winning two matches in a row and two extra stars for winning three matches in a row. Additionally, if you win a match 2-0 you will earn an additional star.\nPlayers are matched against opponents with similar ranks. To avoid delays in matching, if we don\u2019t have an opponent for you with a similar rank, we start widening the search for an opponent.\nBronze division is special. Once you graduate out of Bronze division, you cannot go back down into it for the season. Similarly, once you reach Cosmic division in the season, you can not go back down to Platinum for the season.\nCosmic division ranks the top 100 players in it, but can accommodate any number of players. So for Cosmic, you can be Cosmic 1, Cosmic 2, Cosmic 3 and so on until Cosmic 100. Then anyone after Cosmic 100 is referred to as Cosmic. Cosmic ranks the first 100 players by the internal MMR that we use. All cosmic matchmaking is done using the MMR.\nSeasons are slated to last for two months. At the end of the season, players receive sleeve rewards based on their highest ladder rank in the season. Then players\u2019 ranks are reset. High ranked players will gain a small starting bonus at the start of a subsequent season to once again make sure that they aren\u2019t disrupting the play experience for newer players on their way up.\nThen the big question is: What can you earn by playing in the ladder during its inaugural season?\nEach player that participates in the League will have access to a Season 1 Sleeve. You will instantly get access to the sleeve of your rank during the season, and the sleeve will automatically update itself to match your current rank should it change. At the end of the season the sleeve matching your highest rank achieved will be added to your sleeve collection.\nDuring the season, players will have their deck pedestal decorated with a plinth of their current rank. This will carry over into all games during the season so your opponents will know just how much to fear you.\nPlayers can earn two AA cards during each season. In Season 1 those two cards are Arcane Focus AA and Scorch AA. You can earn a play set of these alternate art cards by participating in both Limited and Constructed ladder play.\nEach time you move up to a new rank you\u2019ll earn something new. Some of the rewards are gold and Primal Dawn packs. You only earn the reward the first time you achieve a new rank.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the new UI that will be introduced with the launch of the Ladder:\nA streamlined interface that allows players to focus on current events and provides contextual information depending on which event they are interested in. At the bottom is the ladder interface that tracks your current ranks for both Limited and Constructed.\nClick on the buttons on the shield to get tournament details or participate in an event.\nThis tracks your rank progress and shows you how many stars you currently need to move up in rank. You can toggle it open and shut via the arrow button at the top. You can click on the individual ranks to see the rewards you can earn within those ranks. Leaderboards for both Limited and Constructed are also viewable within this interface.\nI want to end this with a gentle reminder: this is Season 1 for the ladder. We will definitely be evaluating the results at the end of Season 1 and throughout the season collecting feedback from players. Please expect that nothing is set in stone with regards to the ladder. With that said, I\u2019ll see you in the cosmic tier!\nCorey Burkhart", "early_access": false}

It is hard to believe, and even harder to believe how much progress we have made over the past 12 months. With the introduction of our first major piece of PVE content, the launch (finally) of our 4th set, Primal Dawn, and the thrilling introduction of eSports to the game with our HEX Invitational, it has been a huge year. And I know the next year is going to be even bigger and better!\nI was looking at last year\u2019s birthday update\nin preparation for writing this, and one thing I realized was it talked a lot about the past and how we got here. So rather than re-hash that, I will talk more about the future and where HEX is heading. Of course in the last update, I also spent some time thanking everyone, and it just wouldn\u2019t feel right if I didn\u2019t do that again\u2026 so, my special thanks to everyone playing the game for their dedication and passion. It has been remarkable to see the community continue to grow. The content currently generated by HEX players is stunning, I am always amazed by the tournaments, streamers, writers, and everything else our community brings to the game.\nSo, to the future of HEX. In the immediate future we will be launching our ladders and ranking system! This is a feature I have been very excited about and looking forward to for quite some time and cannot wait for it to launch. We will also include other much anticipated stuff in this patch, such as the Spectral Oak / Spectral Acorn and some very nice quality of life changes to the pass priority interface.\nAfter that, we have Set 5 and Adventure Zone 2 on the way, and I am thrilled to say both are shaping up to be great. I want to say again we are committed to launching a new PVP set every 4-5 months and will be looking to make that happen moving forward. We understand how important it is to keep the PVP content fresh and we have made it a priority and are on track for just that with set 5. And speaking of PVP, we hope to announce our next big eSports event in the near future.\nAlso, we will be FOR SURE announcing your new Community Manager next week! EXCITEMENT!\nLet me finish this by thanking you again for your dedication to HEX and for traveling with us on this long road from great concept to finished game, clearly many of the steps are ugly and difficult but slowly we are getting there.\nSo let\u2019s see the next piece of our 10 YEAR LONG birthday themed adventure comic, and what nefarious plan the Pinatoos King is hatching\u2026\nThis year\u2019s comic begins on page 12 and is the theme for the 3rd Birthday sleeve (seen above).

One of the highlights of working here at HEX TCG is watching how the players interact with new cards and finding the synergies and nuances laid out in a set, including some things that we may not have been expecting. We\u2019ve been closely watching how you\u2019ve been incorporating Primal Dawn in your decks, watching what is making it into tournament decks, and how the constructed meta game is evolving. These things help us plan more exciting cards and set construction for the future.\nQuite a few Evolving Sealed Gauntlet tournaments have been played internally as well, and we\u2019ve been enjoying it as much as you have. We also look at the data from these tournaments to see what kind of decks and champions are being played, as we are vigilant in looking for outliers in the format both from what we expected and from what has been unexpected.\nThe R&D team uses a huge chunk of the development process balancing the limited format. Evaluating the cards through the limited format lens takes a nuanced touch and many, many test sessions. Things seem to be shaping up nicely, but we\u2019ll keep a close eye on it.\nVIP tournament reward cards will be new this month with Primal Dawn alternate art cards being awarded during the VIP tournaments on May 27th, 28th, and 29th.

We released new patches, new content, and we pushed out a mountain of Community Challenges for you to sink your teeth into. (And boy,\n.) That's why we're thrilled to be back to make 2018 an even better time to hang out with us in Mordor.\nThis month we've already got a lot in store for you \u2013 so we're just going to get right to it:\nThe Nemesis System is all about creating your own personal stories. Last year, we added even more possibilities with the release of the Slaughter and Outlaw tribes. With them came all manner of new enemies to fight, kill, and recruit - creating a countless number of new characters for you as the Bright Lord to encounter.\nNow it\u2019s time for a new tale to begin as you step into the role of the legendary Elven assassin, Eltariel.\nThis year we'll be releasing our first story DLC, The Blade of Galadriel, to further tell Eltariel's story. It's set to release in early February, so we\u2019ve got new some looks at live gameplay and interviews with the developers, all month long. (Read below for more details!)\nWe see you, Shadow of War Community. We see how good you\u2019ve gotten at our game. We see your desire for an extra challenge. And, we see you conquering Gravewalker difficulty without batting an eye. That\u2019s why in 2018 \u2013 Elite Challenges are coming back.\nFor those of you just joining us, Elite Challenges are issued to the entire community by us here at Monolith, and they require a firm mastery of Shadow of War and the Nemesis System to complete.\nAnd, like last time, we won\u2019t be giving you any time to prepare!\nWe\u2019ll be issuing them as they arrive, right on our forums\n. You\u2019re going to want to keep an eye out, because we\u2019ve got some cool prizes to hand out \u2013 like the statue of Carnan/Tar-Goroth from our Mithril Editions, exclusive Shadow of War concept art lithographs signed by the development team, and signed game soundtracks - among other things.\nBuilding an army is an essential duty for any Bright Lord. That\u2019s why, this month, we\u2019ve got a bevy of rewards that\u2019ll be ready and waiting for you \u2013 as you complete the month\u2019s Community Challenges.\n\nTo help you get a head-start, here\u2019s a rundown of the month\u2019s in-game Community activities:\nIn 2017, our live streams let us have a direct conversation with you, the community. Plus, it was a great home for our developers to go up in front of you and share their latest and greatest ideas. 2018 will be no different.\nThis month we\u2019re kicking off our first batch of streams in the New Year, with a look at what you\u2019ve been up to - as we marvel at how powerful your Fortresses have become, along with some Online Fight Pits on a variety of platforms, and even some new (and unusual) strategies to help build up your hierarchy.\nBut, we\u2019re also going to take a first look at The Blade of Galadriel story DLC! On January 18th we\u2019ll talk through the opening moments of Eltariel\u2019s story, along with some of the motivations behind the new tale we\u2019ve weaved into Mordor with special guests from the development team.\nFor all the latest be sure to keep an eye on our Official Announcements\nsection! And, as always, you can follow us on Twitch\n, YouTube Gaming, and Mixer\nfor notifications of when we're going live.\nLast year we were thrilled to be able to share Shadow of War with you \u2013 and, we were just getting started. 2018 is looking to be the best year to conquer Middle-earth and we can't wait to see how you'll get the job done.\n-The Shadow of War Community Team", "early_access": false}

Almost everything about this game is at least alright except for one glaring thing...\nThe controls are infuriating, towards the end of the game when mob fighting becomes pretty standard it's disgusting how often you get knocked out of things from a wayward arrow or a grunt who suddenly launches through the air because the game decided he was locked onto you Wraith teleport be damned.. the amount of times my character has glitched out while trying to dominate a captain is depressing not to mention Wraith teleporting into trees, walls, etc. I thouroughly enjoy the game for about 30 minutes until something like this happens, at the end captains hit like trucks so if your controls betray you twice in a fight you're done for, if you die the captain levels up (usually far past your own level) making them impossible to be dominated unless shamed which is depressing because shame tends to ruin them.\nAnyway, the game suffers from the controls so often that I find it to be a slog.. not to mention the actual slog it becomes (which I'm okay with, I enjoy grinding... huehue).\nP.S.\nYet another gripe with the controls being if you do end up getting knocked out of anything the controls seem to queue up your previous command... say you get hit by a grunt and then want to drain the grunt you press and hold drain while you're \"stunned\" and it will sit there doing nothing, so you let go of drain and try it again and you instead Wraith punch at nothing.

Oh don't even try to press Del key because it will break your game completely. You will have to reinstall the game if you press Del key while in game. This game is completely buggy and have many things that need to be fixing and rebalanced. Like sometime game itself will flash in green color and I would have to change the video setting to fix it every time. It does not have much video option and no v-sync option either. So its basically a screen tearing game since there is no fps cap on it. At the moment the paid kits are p2w in some way. You cant even get scoped guns unless you happen to find a air drop. Paid kit came with scoped gun easily. Game chat system blows because everyone can see your texts to team. It totally needs to be fixed. Enemies will set up tents near your base and camping there. Devs need to do something about this. This game has potential to be great game to play. But it needs a lot of improvments. For now I would not recommend this game till things get fixed first. I will come back and give thumb up if it indeed get better.\nUPDATE: 12/12/2017: I decided to uninstall this game due annoying rubber banding, green screen flickering, and weird crashing bugs like it prevent me from do anything all of sudden out of no where.

I know all too well about it being possible to ruin a really fun game, as of now, it's going great.\nBase reinforment is an awesome concept. Being able to destroy, what I assume to be everything, with non-grenade explosives is awesome. You can also set yourself up with a mobile spawn point in the crafting, that lets you spawn anywhere. I mean, you can basically just make a new base right next to the enemy. Which, with the update today, you might be able to do with some of your teammates, with the in game team chat.\nOr you can play a game of diss the snipers.\nIn regards to the assumed P2W aspect, I disagree with it. You can find the guns just lying around on the map, or loot them from guys they died. So, it's not like it restricts you from getting these things. The only thing I haven't seen just around as loot would be snipers, but I havent' explored the massive map yet to confirm that.\nI like this game.\nI haven't gotten to try vehicles yet. You have to survive and stock up, alone or with your team to get something. The XP system, I think, needs some work. But, we'll see where they go with this class system.

If it is supposed to stay running in the background, there is no information making the reason for this apparent (no task tray icon, dialog box, etc.).

Hoje, dia 15 de Novembro, \u00e0s 22:00 BRT o Black Desert Online ser\u00e1 lan\u00e7ado no Steam, abrindo suas portas para a comunidade do Steam e todas suas ferramentas. Neste post explicaremos tudo que voc\u00ea precisa saber para n\u00e3o perder nada!\nEm comemora\u00e7\u00e3o a esta data e ao Black Friday, estamos come\u00e7ando as nossas promo\u00e7\u00f5es da Black Friday com 40% de Desconto em Todos os Pacotes de Jogo (exceto o Pacote de Presente) tanto na nossa Loja quanto no Steam.

O Musah \u00e9 uma classe corpo a corpo que empunha uma espada como arma principal e um arco de chifre como arma secund\u00e1ria, e ele depende de rea\u00e7\u00f5es r\u00e1pidas para permanecer sempre \u00e0 frente de seus inimigos. Com uma mobilidade incr\u00edvel e especialidade de ataques em \u00e1rea, o Musah se destaca em PvP de pequena escala, mas suas defesas baixas o tornam um pouco mais complicado de ser dominado em PvP de grande escala. O Musah atinge seu auge enquanto avan\u00e7a atravessando o campo de batalha para desferir poderosos ataques em \u00e1rea em seus inimigos, mas cada movimento n\u00e3o calculado pode ser fatal devido \u00e0s suas baixas defesas.\nO territ\u00f3rio de Val\u00eancia traz novos conte\u00fados, conhecimentos, NPCs, monstros e miss\u00f5es. Um destaque especial desta atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o vasto Deserto, onde os jogadores ter\u00e3o suas habilidades de sobreviv\u00eancia testadas.

Controls are anti-intuitive, requiring surgical precision to simply open chests. Automatic view and targeting options are non-existent. Monsters can easily interrupt your attacks, but you can barely (if ever) interrupt theirs. Anti-Blindside Game Mechanics: Why? Why even? Your split-second timing is rewarded with a crit to the face? Really? Bounce off the armor, to be sure, but punishment for accuracy in such a critical (no pun intended) game element? Boss Fights: Don't make any plans for the next half hour, and that's just a single attempt. Main character can sprint a total of 10 feet before getting tired (I'm fat and old, and I can still sprint 100 yards before I need to admit that I'm having a heart attack). Main character cannot climb anything - only jump down. Main character cannot step over any landscape feature larger than a dead squirrel, and will hang up upon encountering said landscape feature. Flying opponents will freely engage the group, though the group (despite having ranged weapons) cannot engage the flying opponents. What's more: Flying opponents will float along, completely ignoring you, despite all of your best efforts to attract them to combat... until you've passed under them - at which point they will ambush you from behind, despite your wariness of their existance and eagerness to engage them in combat. Those are the nits.\nThe story is kinda meh. The plot is kinda meh. I didn't expect a Shakesperian presentation, to be fair. I got exactly what I paid for, in those departments.\nBoiling these things down: The game has the potential to be engaging and entertaining, if the raw mechanics didn't drag the progression to an intolerable slog.\nThings might be better with some kind of controller, but if you're a hardened keyboard-and-mouse player like myself - save yourself the grief and pass.\nI love the Star Ocean IP, but this could have been done ~much~ better.", "hours": 15.7, "user_id": "76561198022646537", "username": "Stormraven", "products": 460, "early_access": false}

(for some people you will have to go to your Nividia Control Panel, add the game , and put on the Vsync option) Game looks beautiful and runs pretty smoothly,  my only problem with the game at this moment is that during combat, skills will cause a small pause in frame with each connected hit so when there is a large amount of enemies grouped up around you and your using a skill, it begins to lag. Fix this port and others that have been mentioned besides mine and im sure this game will be highly recommended.

{"product_id": "378860", "page": 8, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-02", "text": "To put it short, I really do recommend this game. The amount of possibilities within this game are fantastic, from a classic Rallycross race around DirtFish using old Ford Escorts to a modern WEC Endurance race fighting LMP1 cars and GTE cars against one another around the Le Mans circuit for hours.\nPros:\nTracks: Fantastic amount of tracks and variation, with a good mix of long tracks, short, road circuits, sprint races and rallycross tracks. There's also variations of each track so you get more choice on what route of the track you wish to race on. There's also historic versions of tracks such of Spa and Monza which I found a great addition to the game.\nCars: Lots of cars, especially for those that love race cars. With numerous amounts of cars from classes such as GT3, GT4, LMP1, WRX, Group A, Touring Cars, Indycar and so on. There's bound to be a vehicle for you. There's also a handful of road cars to use, though these could do with some additions. There's also track day cars such as the McLaren P1 GTR and Aston Martin Vulcan, which may I add sounds absolutely phenomenal, which brings me to my next point.\nSounds: The sounds within the game are just superb. As previously stated, the Aston Martin Vulcan sounds fantastic, hearing that mighty V12 engine fly past you is a sound to hear. And the variation in the sound of each car is great and shows that SMS didn't cut corners and use the same sounds for multiple cars. Also, just as a personal point, the WRX are some of the nicest sounding cars I've ever heard. Sliding round corners with the Honda Civic WRX, listening to the engine roaring and the backfire is truly something.\nGraphics: Project CARS 1 was praised for its photo realistic graphics, and this sequel is no different in the quality it gives. Unlike games such as Forza and GT Sport which go for more eye candy than photo realistic, Project CARS 2 may not look as nice as the other two, but it looks the most photo realistic.\nWeather: The weather within this game is next level. With the introduction of Live Track 3.0, SMS rwally upped their game with this. The fact you can start a race in clear dry conditions, to then advance to a thunder storm, where puddles form around the lower sections of track, surfaces become slippery and then go to an overcast evening, giving time for some of the puddles to dry up and the cars to dry the track as they continue to race and then for it to become night time and a blizzard cones along, removing the view of the drivers and really giving them a hard time, forming puddles around the track and making the experience something new. This is what I had in one of my first races on this game at Le Mans in a 2 hour race in a Nissan GTR GT3 (it was a custom race, of course).\nPhysics: The most important part of this game, the physics. Though not perfect, they are pretty good, especially for the race cars such as the GT3 or Formula A. It has massively improved over the last game, as you can now drift vehicles properly, you can stop your car from completely spinning out and so on. It also works very well with a controller this time, as I put my first 50 hours into this game using a knock off Xbox 360 controller and really enjoyed it. With wheel, well, it's obviously even more fun. The rallycross cars feel fantastic in this game with a wheel, and are definitely some of the most fun cars to drive in this game.\nNow, the cons:\nTracks: Not too much for the tracks, other than the game could do with more road races like the California Highway, as this is certainly one of the more fun tracks, and road tracks are lacking greatly in this game, as well as spring tracks such as California Highway.\nCars: Could definitely do with more road cars, as these are very low in number, especially within the lower classes. The game could also do better off with more liveries for some cars such as the Bentley, more solid colours for car such as the Ford Raptor, more custom livery spots for vehicles and a way to download custom liveties in game through some kind of workshop.\nGraphics: My main dislike with the graphics is the snow, as I don't think it looks very good, especially once it has landed on cars. I also get a bug quite often where the grass starts floating in the air which can be quite annoying.\nWeather: Can't say there's much wrong with it, as it's all very good. More types of weather would always be fun, such as hail, strong winds, heat waves and so on.\nPhysics: these could definitely be better, especially for the road cars, as I often find some of these very difficult to drive. Cars such as Renault Clio TC1 is very odo to drive, as I find it seems to slide a lot and in some cases tips over.\nOverall, I think this is one amazing game, and couldn't recommend it more to anyone that's looking to get into some simple racing or is a car/motorsport enthusiast.", "hours": 109.9, "username": "Sono", "products": 200, "early_access": false}

Every \"package\" (i.e. stage) contains several \"files\" (i.e. levels) that have bugs which must be found and fixed. You need to avoid obstacles like enemies and spikes along the way, as well as surviving against the package's glitches. Each package has a set of glitches across all the files which change characteristics of the world (such as enemy size doubling or low gravity). As well as finding the bug in each level, there are also secondary objectives to be found that let you play a fun mini-game for a chance to permanently remove a glitch from the package to make those levels a bit easier. There's also glitches that you can find along the way to collect and use for yourself as a special move to help beat the level (such as jetpacks or inverting gravity). If you have a tough time or don't like the glitches for a particular package, you can refactor it which re-assigns a new random set of glitches to the package at the cost of losing deadline time.\nI've been having a lot of fun with it. The gradual build-up of difficulty on each package feels great and gets fairly challenging toward the last one. The inventive gameplay feels very well balanced in many ways and makes you want to immediately keep trying again after death. The game has a very unique feel to it with well-designed graphics and sound. I didn't experience any technical issues and the user interface is solid too. If I had to choose, it kind of reminds me of a hybrid of Pony Island, Rogue Legacy, Broforce, and Super Meat Boy. The only thing that I could see some people not liking is the character's jumping/movement which is very quick/fluid and tends to overshoot easily such as in Super Meat Boy.\nDefinitely worth the price!", "hours": 4.1, "username": "fantomchoder", "products": 523, "early_access": false}
