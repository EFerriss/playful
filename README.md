# playful

## What is playful?
I used data from the Steam game store to build [an app called playful](http://playful.live) to make computer game recommendations for Steam users using [collaborative filtering with implicit feedback](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf). Playfull was built in 3 weeks in January, 2018 as part of my [Insight](http://insightdatascience.com/) Data Science Fellowship.

## The app
The app is written with flask and hosted on AWS. All files for building the app are in the app folder except (1) the config.py file containing the API key and (2) the item similarity matrix used to make the recommendations, which is too large to put on GitHub. 

## How to make the item similarity matrix
Jupyter notebooks coming soon!
