## What is playful?
I used data from the Steam game store to build [an app called playful](http://playful.live) to make computer game recommendations for Steam users using [collaborative filtering with implicit feedback](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf). Playfull was built in 3 weeks in January, 2018 as part of my [Insight](http://insightdatascience.com/) Data Science Fellowship.
